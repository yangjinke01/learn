I have about three years work experience.

I spent most of my time on studding computer during my college year. 

I am good at Linux operation, it's very cool,  I wanna be a hacker then.

I am good at Java Web development based on spring, spring boot and MyBatis.

My major work was DevOps. I create a pipeline for every project.

When some code was committed and pushed to GitLab，the pipeline was triggered. 

A pipeline include some stages, such as code check、pack、publish、deployment and auto test. 

I am interested in new technology such as Kubernetes. 

I migrated some of  package tasks from virtual machines to Kubernetes. 

I wrote a web application during my free time, this web application allow you upload a picture, then the application can change the picture's backgroud to whatever color you choose.
