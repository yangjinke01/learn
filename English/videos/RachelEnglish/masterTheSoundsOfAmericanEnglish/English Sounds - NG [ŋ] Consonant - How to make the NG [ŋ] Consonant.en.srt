00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,700
In this American English Pronunciation video,

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:08,440
we're going to learn how to make the NG consonant sound.

3
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:19,540
To make this sound, the jaw drops a little
bit.

4
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:24,340
Ng-- The lips part and the back part of the tongue

5
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:28,180
stretches all the way up to the soft palate.

6
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:30,320
The tongue tip is forward.

7
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:36,620
Because the soft palate is lowered,
air comes up through the nasal passages.

8
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:39,860
This makes it a nasal consonant.

9
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:43,660
You can feel the vibration in your nose.

10
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:45,420
Ng--

11
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,960
There are only 3 nasal sounds in American English.

12
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:55,540
Nn-- Ng-- Mm--

13
00:00:55,540 --> 00:01:00,580
Let's study it up close and in slow motion.

14
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:03,260
A relaxed, lowered jaw.

15
00:01:03,269 --> 00:01:06,690
Since this sound is made at the back of the mouth,

16
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:09,400
it's hard to get a clear picture of it.

17
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:15,100
The tongue lifts in the back while the tip
stays down and forward.

18
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:17,600
The word 'ring'.

19
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,480
The tongue lifts in the back, while the tip
stays down and forward.

20
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:25,160
Lips are relaxed.

21
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,320
The word 'along'.

22
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:33,940
Since the tongue is low for the vowel before,
it's easier to see the tongue lift in the back.

23
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:38,880
And now, it's lifted in the back with relaxed
lips.

24
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,420
The word 'finger'.

25
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:48,780
Again, the tongue lifts in the back while
the tip stays down and forward.

26
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:54,740
This sound can occur in the middle or at the
end of a word in American English,

27
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:57,520
but not at the beginning.

28
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,020
The NG consonant.

29
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:02,160
Ring.

30
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,520
Along.

31
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,520
Finger.

32
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,460
Example words.

33
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:10,940
Repeat with me.

34
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,680
Anger.

35
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:17,920
Ng-- Anger.

36
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,420
Song.

37
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:28,200
Ng-- Song.

38
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,180
Wing.

39
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:38,180
Ng-- Wing.

40
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:40,540
English.

41
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:48,120
Ng-- English. Single.

42
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:54,400
Ng-- Single.

43
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,440
Beginning.

44
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:03,180
Ng-- Beginning.

45
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:09,600
This video is one of 36 in a new series, The
Sounds of American English.

46
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:14,640
Videos in this set will be released here on
YouTube twice a month,

47
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,860
first and third Thursdays, in 2016 and 2017.

48
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:24,400
But the whole set can be all yours right now.

49
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:30,200
The real value of these videos is watching
them as a set, as a whole,

50
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:35,220
to give your mind the time to take it all
in and get the bigger picture.

51
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:41,940
Most of the materials you'll find elsewhere
just teach the sounds on their own in isolation.

52
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:44,740
It's a mistake to learn them this way.

53
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:50,840
We learn the sounds to speak words and sentences,
not just sounds.

54
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:54,060
Move closer to fluency in spoken English.
