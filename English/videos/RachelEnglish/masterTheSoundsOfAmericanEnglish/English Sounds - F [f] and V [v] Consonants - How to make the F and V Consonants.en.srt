00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,020
In this American English pronunciation video,

2
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:10,140
we're going to go over how to pronounce the F and V consonants.

3
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:22,220
These two sounds are paired together because they take the same mouth position.

4
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:27,260
FF is unvoiced, meaning only air passes through the mouth,

5
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:34,100
and VV is voiced, meaning you make a sound with the vocal cords.

6
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:36,100
VV

7
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,940
To make these sounds,

8
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:43,020
the bottom lip lifts and touches the very bottom of the top front teeth.

9
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:47,160
Ff-- Vv--

10
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:52,800
The top lip lifts a little bit to get out of the way of the bottom lip.

11
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,700
You don't want to see your bottom lip disappear.

12
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:59,200
Ff--

13
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:03,860
It's actually the inside of the lip, here,

14
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:07,280
that makes contact with the teeth.

15
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,200
Ff-- Vv--

16
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,940
The tongue should stay relaxed so the air can easily push through,

17
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:21,220
causing the bottom lip to vibrate against the top teeth.

18
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:25,180
Let's look at the sounds up close and in slow motion.

19
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:29,320
The top lip lifts so the bottom lip has room to vibrate

20
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:33,020
against the bottom of the top front teeth.

21
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:40,440
Very. Bottom lip goes to the bottom of the top front teeth.

22
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:46,740
Flavor. The bottom lip goes to the top front teeth for the F

23
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:50,660
and again for the V.

24
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:57,860
Enough. Bottom lip to top front teeth.

25
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:02,720
When you work on these consonants and words with these consonants,

26
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:08,620
watch yourself and make sure your bottom lip doesn't curl in.

27
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:12,280
Ff-- Vv--

28
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:17,380
Remember it's the inside of the lip that makes these sounds.

29
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:20,840
The F and V consonants.

30
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,120
Very

31
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,120
Flavor

32
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,620
Enough

33
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:31,920
Example words. Repeat with me.

34
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:39,700
Live, vv--, Live

35
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:47,640
Value, vv--, value

36
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:55,120
Provide, vv--, provide

37
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:03,600
Fresh, ff--, fresh

38
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:10,960
Offer, ff--, offer

39
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:18,260
Tough, ff--, tough

40
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:24,620
This video is one of 36 in a new series, The Sounds of American English.

41
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:29,760
Videos in this set will be released here on YouTube twice a month,

42
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:35,080
first and third Thursdays, in 2016 and 2017.

43
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:39,580
But the  whole set can be all yours right now.

44
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:45,280
The real value of these videos is watching them as a set, as a whole,

45
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,360
to give your mind the time to take it all in and get the bigger picture.

46
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:57,060
Most of the materials you'll find elsewhere just teach the sounds on their own in isolation.

47
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:59,860
It's a mistake to learn them this way.

48
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:05,880
We learn the sounds to speak words and sentences, not just sounds.

49
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:09,280
Move closer to fluency in spoken English.
