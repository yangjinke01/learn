1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:03,060
In this American English pronunciation

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:05,130
video, we’re going to learn how to

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:09,690
pronounce the AA as in BAT vowel.

4
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:19,359
This is a sound that changes depending

5
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,250
on the following sound. So, it can either

6
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:25,710
be a pure vowel or a modified vowel.

7
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:29,269
We’ll go over both in this video.

8
00:00:29,269 --> 00:00:32,259
To make the pure AA vowel, the jaw

9
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:37,239
drops quite a bit, AA.

10
00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:39,649
The tip of the tongue stays forward; it’s

11
00:00:39,649 --> 00:00:41,510
touching the back of the bottom front

12
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:45,620
teeth, AA. The back part of the tongue

13
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:47,320
stretches up.

14
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:52,110
The tongue is wide, AA. Because the

15
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:54,460
tongue is high in the back and low in

16
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:57,940
the front, you can see a lot of it. This is

17
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:00,489
different from the 'ah' as in 'father'

18
00:01:00,489 --> 00:01:02,899
vowel, for example, where the tongue

19
00:01:02,899 --> 00:01:05,489
presses down in the back and you see

20
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:13,020
more dark space in the mouth. AA, AH.

21
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,090
You can also see the corners of the

22
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:20,860
mouth pull back and up a little bit. AA.

23
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:23,840
Let’s take a look at the pure AA vowel

24
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,009
up close and in slow motion.

25
00:01:27,009 --> 00:01:29,220
The tongue tip is down and the back of

26
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:34,909
the tongue lifts. Here’s the word ‘sat’.

27
00:01:34,909 --> 00:01:37,729
The tongue position is easy to see

28
00:01:37,729 --> 00:01:40,030
because of the jaw drop needed for this

29
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:43,000
vowel.

30
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,540
When AA is in a stressed syllable, the

31
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,979
vowel will go up and come down in

32
00:01:48,979 --> 00:01:57,119
pitch, AA. Sat, AA. In an unstressed

33
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,850
syllable, the vowel is flatter and lower

34
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:05,320
in pitch, quieter, aa. This vowel is

35
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:08,039
unstressed in the second syllable of

36
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:11,639
‘backtrack’. Let’s look up close and

37
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,440
in slow motion.

38
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,260
In the first, stressed syllable, the jaw

39
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:18,590
drops, and we see the corners of the

40
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:21,340
lips pull back and up for the stressed

41
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:24,950
AA. In the unstressed syllable, the jaw

42
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:28,390
drops less. Let’s compare them.

43
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:31,950
On top is the stressed AA. You can see

44
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:35,360
the jaw drops more. For the unstressed

45
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,800
AA, the corners of the lips are a little

46
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,780
more relaxed than in the stressed

47
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:42,180
version, where they pull slightly back

48
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,400
and up.

49
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,860
Generally, the unstressed version of a

50
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:48,700
vowel or diphthong is more relaxed and

51
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:51,390
doesn’t take the full mouth position, in

52
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:53,870
this case, a little less jaw drop, and

53
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:57,290
relaxed lips. This is because unstressed

54
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:00,019
syllables are shorter, so we don’t take

55
00:03:00,019 --> 00:03:03,480
the time to make the full position.

56
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,090
At the beginning of this video, I said the

57
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:10,110
AA vowel is not always a pure AA. This

58
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:12,400
vowel changes when it’s followed by a

59
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,459
nasal consonant. When it’s followed by

60
00:03:15,459 --> 00:03:19,530
the M or N sounds, the tongue relaxes

61
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:23,650
in the back, making an UH sound after

62
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:28,860
AA. AA-UH. It’s not a pure AA sound.

63
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,900
Unfortunately, this change is not

64
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,879
represented in the International

65
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:37,140
Phonetic Alphabet. It’s still written with

66
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:41,190
the same AA symbol. So, you just have

67
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:44,159
to know when it’s followed by [m] or

68
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,159
[n], it’s different.

69
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:52,500
We don’t say ‘man’, aa, ‘man’, with a

70
00:03:52,500 --> 00:04:00,239
pure AA. We say ‘man’, aa-uh, aa-uh,

71
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,430
relaxing the tongue and corners of the

72
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:05,269
lips before the consonant. You can

73
00:04:05,269 --> 00:04:09,239
think of this UH relaxation as the ‘uh’ as

74
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:13,290
in ‘butter’ sound or schwa sound. Let’s

75
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:16,489
look up close and in slow motion at the

76
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:19,299
word ‘exam’.

77
00:04:19,299 --> 00:04:21,410
First we see the familiar shape of the

78
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:23,940
mouth, when the AA is in a stressed

79
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:26,800
syllable. Watch how the relaxation

80
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,440
happens: the corners of the lips relax

81
00:04:30,449 --> 00:04:33,759
in. The tongue will relax down in the

82
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,650
back. And the lips close for the M

83
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:40,320
consonant.

84
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,220
This relaxation of the corner of the lips

85
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:45,410
and back of the tongue happens when

86
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,639
the AA vowel is followed by the N

87
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:50,509
consonant as well. For example, the

88
00:04:50,509 --> 00:04:58,180
word ‘hand’. Haa-uhnd. Hand.

89
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:01,260
So, when you see this symbol followed

90
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:05,280
by this symbol or this symbol, it’s no

91
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,240
longer a pure AA. Think of relaxing out

92
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,500
of the vowel, AA-UH.

93
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,500
If the next sound is the NG consonant,

94
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:19,639
it’s a little different. Rather than ‘aa-

95
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:24,580
uh’, the vowel changes into AY. It’s

96
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:28,960
really like the AY as in SAY diphthong.

97
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,460
First, the middle part of the tongue lifts

98
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:34,070
towards the roof of the mouth, then the

99
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:37,880
front part of the tongue. Let’s watch

100
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:41,889
‘gang’ up close and in slow motion.

101
00:05:41,889 --> 00:05:44,280
The position for the first sound looks a

102
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,650
lot like AA, but the part of the tongue

103
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:51,760
lifting up is more forward. Gaaaang.

104
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,740
Then the front part of the tongue

105
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:55,580
arches up towards the roof of the

106
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:58,060
mouth, while the tongue tip remains

107
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:00,160
down.

108
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,039
When you see this symbol followed by

109
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:06,370
this symbol, it’s no longer a pure AA.

110
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:15,580
It’s more like AY. Gang. Thanks.

111
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:22,759
Pure stressed AA: Sat, aa

112
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:28,839
Pure unstressed AA: backtrack, aa

113
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:35,240
AA, aa, AA, aa.

114
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:42,400
AA vowel modified by M: exam, aa-uh

115
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:49,920
AA vowel modified by N: man, aa-uh

116
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:58,020
AA vowel modified by NG: gang, ay

117
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:00,870
Example words. Repeat with me:
