1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:03,189
In this American English pronunciation

2
00:00:03,189 --> 00:00:05,440
video, we’re going to go over how to

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,860
pronounce the IH as in SIT vowel.

4
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:19,340
This vowel can be a challenge for non-

5
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:22,240
native speakers. The tendency is to

6
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,820
replace it with the EE vowel. But for

7
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:31,400
the IH vowel, the jaw drops more, so the

8
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,719
tongue isn’t as close to the roof of the

9
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:38,140
mouth. Let’s study the mouth position.

10
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:41,200
There’s a relaxed jaw drop. The tip of

11
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,460
the tongue stays forward, lightly

12
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,300
touching the back of the bottom front

13
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,660
teeth. The top, front part of the tongue

14
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:50,530
arches up towards the roof of the

15
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:52,080
mouth.

16
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:56,620
Let’s see this vowel up close and in slow motion.

17
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:00,210
Relaxed jaw drop. Tongue tip forward.

18
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:03,660
Top, front part of the tongue arches up

19
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:06,119
towards the roof of the mouth. This

20
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:11,040
vowel is stressed in the word ‘fix’.

21
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,420
Same mouth position.

22
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:17,939
When this vowel is in a stressed word

23
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:22,590
or syllable, like ‘fix’, it has an up-down

24
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:30,369
shape, IH, fix, IH. When it’s in an

25
00:01:30,369 --> 00:01:33,259
unstressed syllable, it will be flatter and

26
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:39,310
lower in pitch, quieter: ih, ih. It’s

27
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:44,390
unstressed in the word ‘office’, ih.

28
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:46,820
Let's take a look.

29
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:49,220
The mouth position is the same, but a

30
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:52,760
little more relaxed.

31
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:57,100
Let’s compare the stressed IH in ‘fix’, on

32
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:01,420
the top, to the unstressed IH in ‘office’.

33
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:04,100
Notice that the jaw is more dropped for

34
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:06,640
the stressed syllable. For the

35
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,760
unstressed IH, the jaw is less dropped.

36
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,020
This is typical. Unstressed vowels are

37
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:17,800
shorter, so there isn’t as much time to

38
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,640
make the full mouth position.

39
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:26,650
Stressed IH: fix, IH

40
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:32,930
Unstressed IH: office, ih

41
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:40,680
IH, ih, IH, ih

42
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:45,010
Example words. Repeat with me:

43
00:02:45,010 --> 00:03:29,269
Which, instead, begin, divorce, busy, print.
