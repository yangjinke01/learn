00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,720
In this American English pronunciation video,

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:07,800
we're going to learn how to 
make the R consonant sound.

3
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:19,140
This is truly one of the hardest 
sounds in American English.

4
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:25,200
Before I go into how to make it, I 
want to talk about how not to make it.

5
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:30,240
In many languages, the R is 
made by bouncing the front  

6
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,820
part of the tongue against the roof of the mouth.

7
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,380
Rr-- rr--

8
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:41,880
In American English, this sound 
is the T or D between vowels.

9
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:45,180
But it's quite different from the American R.

10
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:52,320
Rrrr--- You can't hold out rra-- rra--

11
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,740
But you should be able to hold out the American R.

12
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:01,260
This consonant is voiced.

13
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,500
There are two ways to make this sound.

14
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:10,500
In the first way, the front part of the 
tongue pulls back and up, like this.

15
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,320
The tongue can be stretched 
so it's long and skinny.

16
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:24,300
Or it can be pulled into itself 
so it's fatter and thicker.

17
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,220
And that's what we want here.

18
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:30,960
We're making the tongue fatter 
and thicker so it's not as long.

19
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:35,340
The back doesn't move. This is happening in front

20
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:41,700
The middle part of the tongue lifts 
up towards the roof of the mouth.

21
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,980
You can touch the sides of the tongue

22
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:46,500
to the sides of the roof of the mouth here

23
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,720
or to the inside or bottom of the side teeth here.

24
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,920
The front part of the tongue is 
hanging in the middle of the mouth

25
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,780
not touching anything.

26
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,720
This sound is forward and focused 
because of the position of the lips.

27
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:08,220
The corners come in, pushing 
the lips away from the face.

28
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:11,820
This lip position will be a little more relaxed

29
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:14,880
when the R comes at the end of the syllable.

30
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:19,020
We'll compare this way on the left,

31
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:22,740
with the other way to make an R on the right.

32
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:27,180
The R can also be made by 
flipping the tongue tip up.

33
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,820
The lips flare the same way.

34
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:34,140
Some native speakers make the 
R one way, and some, the other.

35
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,480
Native speakers get the correct 
sound no matter the mouth position.

36
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,000
But I found that non-native 
speakers often drop the jaw

37
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,220
too much in this second method.

38
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:51,660
And it makes the sound hollow. RR--

39
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:57,780
The jaw doesn't need to drop 
very much for this sound. Rr--

40
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:03,060
So keep these in mind as you 
work on one of these two methods.

41
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:08,100
Here's the R sound on its own, not part of a word.

42
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,500
You can see the lips flare.

43
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,780
Think of creating a little space on 
the inside of your lips and your teeth.

44
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,200
Notice how little jaw drop there is.

45
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:23,760
We don't need to drop the jaw 
to pull the tongue back and up.

46
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,760
The word 'rest'.

47
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,700
When the R is at the beginning of a word,

48
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:32,880
we tend to make the lips a tight circle.

49
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:39,120
Again, little jaw drop as the middle of 
the tongue lifts to the roof of the mouth.

50
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:44,220
The word 'proud'.

51
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,880
When R is in a beginning consonant cluster,

52
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:52,020
the lips may not be as 
tight as in the beginning R.

53
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,380
The word 'mother', at the end of the syllable,

54
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:04,080
the lip position for the R is definitely 
more relaxed than the beginning R.

55
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,700
But the lips still flare.

56
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:13,020
Here, we compare the lip position 
of the beginning R in 'rest' above,

57
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:16,260
to the ending R in 'mother' below.

58
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:20,460
The ending R lip position is much more relaxed.

59
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,740
Thinking about the lip position 
will help you make a better R sound.

60
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:30,360
As you work on this consonant, 
practice very slowly.

61
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,480
Thinking about all 3 things at once.

62
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,820
Very little jaw drop, the tongue 
position, and the lip position.

63
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,900
Remember, you can hold out this sound.

64
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:45,360
So that's how you want to practice it.

65
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:46,980
Rrrrr--

66
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,560
Hold it out for 5 or 10 seconds.

67
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,800
Hold it out as long as you can.

68
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,580
When you practice it in a word, do the same.

69
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,700
Rest

70
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:06,780
Proud

71
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,820
Mother

72
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,320
The R sound

73
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,120
Rest

74
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,160
Proud

75
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:18,960
Mother

76
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,760
Example words. Repeat with me.

77
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:31,200
Read. Rr-- Read.

78
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:39,120
Great. Rr-- Great.

79
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:46,620
Try. Rr-- Try.

80
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:54,180
Later. Rr-- Later.

81
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:01,920
Right. Rr-- Right.

82
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:09,660
Other. Rr-- Other.
