00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,890
In this American English pronunciation

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:04,740
video, we’re going to learn how to

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:08,220
pronounce the OH as in NO diphthong.

4
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:18,680
Diphthongs are a combination of two

5
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:20,930
sounds. They have a starting position

6
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:23,060
and an ending position.

7
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:25,640
The jaw drops for the beginning

8
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,700
position, tongue shifts back a little bit.

9
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:32,780
The lips may start relaxed, or may start

10
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:34,520
rounding right from the beginning.

11
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:37,460
After dropping the jaw, immediately

12
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:39,620
start moving into the ending position:

13
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:43,010
the lips round, and the back part of the

14
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:45,410
tongue stretches up. Focus on the

15
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:47,720
movement of the jaw and the lip rounding.

16
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:52,100
Let’s see this sound up close and in slow motion.

17
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:56,440
Jaw drop for the first position, and

18
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,810
rounded lips for the second.

19
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:03,550
The word ‘slow’. Notice how the lips

20
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:06,130
are not relaxed in the first position of

21
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:08,260
this diphthong, with the jaw drop.

22
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:11,260
They’re flared, which does not affect

23
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:13,960
the sound, as they prepare to round for

24
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:16,870
the ending position. Rounded lips.

25
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:21,640
In a stressed syllable, the OH diphthong

26
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:28,900
curves up then down. Slow, oh. In an

27
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:31,330
unstressed syllable, it’s lower and

28
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:34,480
flatter in pitch, as well as quieter and

29
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:38,860
quicker, oh. The diphthong is

30
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:45,130
unstressed in the word ‘okay’, oh. Let’s

31
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:47,740
take a look at the word ‘okay’.

32
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:50,890
The jaw drops, but not quite as much as

33
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:54,280
it did on the stressed syllable of ‘slow’.

34
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,830
The lips begin to round for the

35
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:59,680
transition into the ending position. The

36
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,680
lips round, but not quite as much as for

37
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,680
the stressed OH in ‘slow’.

38
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,050
Here we compare the first position of

39
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:12,840
the stressed OH on top with the

40
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,900
unstressed version on the bottom. Less

41
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,180
jaw drop for the unstressed version.

42
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,870
And here, the second position. You can

43
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:25,530
see that for the stressed OH, on top, the

44
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:28,020
lips round more than they do in the

45
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,040
unstressed version.

46
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,310
Generally, the unstressed version of a

47
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:34,830
vowel or diphthong is more relaxed and

48
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:36,840
often doesn’t take the full mouth

49
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:40,470
position, in this case, less jaw drop and

50
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:44,220
less lip rounding. This is because we

51
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:46,530
don’t take as much time for unstressed

52
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:50,130
syllables, they’re shorter, so we simplify

53
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:51,390
the mouth movements.

54
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:57,240
The OH diphthong, stressed: slow, OH

55
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:04,020
Unstressed: okay, oh

56
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:10,650
OH, oh, OH, oh.

57
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:16,740
Example words. Repeat with me:

58
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:19,050
Alone
