00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,340
In this American English pronunciation

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:05,280
video, we’re going to learn how to

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:09,030
pronounce the OW as in NOW diphthong.

4
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:18,990
Diphthongs are a combination of two

5
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:21,420
sounds, so they have a starting position

6
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,550
and an ending position.

7
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:28,410
To start this sound, drop the jaw. The

8
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:31,650
first sound is similar to the AA as in BAT

9
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:36,360
vowel. The tongue is wide and flat, the

10
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:39,420
back stretches up a little bit. The tongue

11
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,730
tip touches the back of the bottom front

12
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:45,660
teeth. The upper lip might lift a little, or

13
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,520
it will be relaxed.

14
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,760
To transition into the second position,

15
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,610
the lips round and the jaw drops less.

16
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:56,520
The back of the tongue stretches up

17
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,780
more. This second position is considered

18
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:04,470
the same as the UH as in PUSH

19
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:07,320
vowel. But when it’s a part of a

20
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,170
diphthong, the lips round more than

21
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,420
when it occurs as a pure vowel.

22
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:17,220
Let’s see this sound up close and in slow motion.

23
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:21,060
Jaw drops. Here, the upper lip pulls a

24
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,880
little bit. The tongue lifts in the back.

25
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,360
Now the lips come in and round as the

26
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,230
jaw comes up.

27
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:33,360
The word ‘wound’. The lips start in a

28
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,510
tight circle for the W, but then open out

29
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:38,850
for the first position of the diphthong

30
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:41,910
before rounding again for the second

31
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:43,110
position of the diphthong.

32
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:48,560
In a stressed syllable, the OW diphthong

33
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:54,800
curves up then down. Wound, OW. In

34
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,590
an unstressed syllable, it’s lower and

35
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:00,650
flatter in pitch, as well as quieter and

36
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:06,020
quicker, ow, ow. The diphthong is

37
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:08,960
unstressed in the word ‘shutdown’, ow.

38
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:13,130
Let’s take a look at this word.

39
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:18,270
Jaw drops, but notice the top lip is

40
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:22,080
relaxed, it doesn’t pull up. Tongue is

41
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,200
lifted in the back. In the ending position,

42
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,230
the lips aren’t quite as rounded as they

43
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:30,420
were in the stressed version of this

44
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:30,990
diphthong.

45
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:34,440
Here you see the jaw drop in the first

46
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,930
position of the diphthong, stressed

47
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:39,720
version on top. Notice that the jaw

48
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,210
doesn’t drop as much for the unstressed

49
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:42,810
diphthong.

50
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:46,770
Here’s the second position. The lips

51
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:49,110
don’t round as much for the unstressed

52
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:52,080
diphthong; they’re more relaxed.

53
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,010
Generally, the unstressed version of a

54
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:58,410
vowel or diphthong is more relaxed and

55
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:00,660
often doesn’t take the full mouth

56
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:04,470
position, in this case, less jaw drop and

57
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:08,190
less lip rounding. This is because we

58
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:10,410
don’t take as much time with unstressed

59
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:13,980
syllables. They’re shorter, so we simplify

60
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,240
the mouth movements.

61
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:21,270
The OW diphthong, stressed: wound, OW

62
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:27,750
Unstressed: shutdown, ow

63
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:32,910
OW, ow, OW, ow.
