1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,000
In this American English pronunciation video,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:16,080
we're going to learn how to 
pronounce the L consonant sound.

3
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,400
This sound is especially difficult.

4
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:24,240
There are actually two kinds of Ls 
and they're not made the same way.

5
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,240
But if you look up a word in the dictionary,

6
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:33,760
there's only one International Phonetic 
Alphabet symbol for both kinds of L.

7
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,280
In this video, you'll learn 
when to make which kind of L.

8
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,320
First, the light L sound.

9
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,600
This is what most people think 
of when they think of an L.

10
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:55,360
The L is a Light L when it comes before 
the vowel or diphthong in a syllable.

11
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:02,960
For example, let’s— flake— release—

12
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:08,880
There are two different ways 
native speakers make this sound.

13
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,320
One way is to lift the 
tongue so the tip is touching  

14
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,000
the roof of the mouth just behind the front teeth.

15
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:24,000
This is not the same as the 
T, D, and N tongue positions

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,760
where the tongue lifts so the top 
is touching the roof of the mouth.

17
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,680
This is the tip.

18
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:35,200
Another way native speakers make 
this sound looks like the TH

19
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:39,840
with the tongue tip touching the 
bottom of the top front teeth.

20
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,200
The contact with the teeth is 
more firm than the TH sound

21
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,520
pushing up on the top teeth.

22
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:53,840
The tongue is not as loose or 
relaxed in the L as it is in the TH.

23
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,160
Let's look at the Light L 
up close and in slow motion.

24
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:06,720
Here's one way to make the L with the 
tongue tip coming through the teeth

25
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:10,480
to press up on the bottom of the top front teeth.

26
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,960
Here's the second way to make the Light L.

27
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,600
The tip at the roof of the 
mouth just behind the teeth.

28
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,080
Here's the word ‘lack’.

29
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,360
The tongue comes through the 
teeth to make the light L.

30
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,680
The word ‘slow’,

31
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:35,840
the Light L is made with the tongue 
tip at the roof of the mouth.

32
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,800
The second kind of L is the Dark L.

33
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,880
This is the sound that happens when the 
L comes after the vowel or diphthong

34
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:52,000
in a word or syllable like ‘real’ or ‘Google’.

35
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:59,840
This sound has two parts but many Americans 
leave out to the second part in most cases.

36
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,840
You should, too. It makes it easier to pronounce.

37
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:10,160
The first and most important part 
of the Dark L is the dark sound.

38
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,960
This defines the Dark L.

39
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,320
To make this sound, you 
don't lift your tongue tip.

40
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:22,400
Instead, it's down touching the 
back of the bottom front teeth.

41
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,400
The back part of the tongue 
pulls back towards the throat.

42
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,840
You can see there isn't much jaw 
drop and the lips are relaxed.

43
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:39,800
Llll— you should feel the vibration 
in the throat and not the face. Lll—

44
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,840
The back part of the tongue 
presses down or shifts back.

45
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:53,600
This is an important part of the sound ull— ull—

46
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,960
Most Americans will stop 
there when making the Dark L.

47
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,840
Real—

48
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,200
Google—

49
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:03,760
Thoughtful—

50
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:11,520
Unless they're linking into a word that begins 
with an L or a sound with a similar position  

51
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,840
like N, T, or D.

52
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,880
In that case, go ahead and make 
the second part of the Dark L.

53
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,040
The second part of the Dark L is the Light L.

54
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:27,840
Bring your tongue tip up to the roof 
of the mouth or through the teeth.

55
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:34,720
Some native speakers make the full 
Dark L both parts all the time.

56
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,080
What's important is the dark sound.

57
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:43,840
Make it with the back of the tongue and 
make sure you never leave that part out.

58
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,400
Ull— ulll—

59
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,040
Again, the Dark L has two parts.

60
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:57,600
The first and most important part, the tongue 
pulls back or presses down in the back.

61
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,360
The second part, which is often left out,

62
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,080
either option for the Light L.

63
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:09,840
Here, the option with the tongue tip 
at the roof of the mouth is pictured.

64
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,040
Let's look at the Dark L up 
close and in slow motion.

65
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,000
The word ‘feel’.

66
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,240
The tongue tip arches in 
the front for the EE vowel.

67
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,040
Watch as the tongue lowers in the back.

68
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:30,480
Now, the tongue is lowered, pulling 
back a little bit in the back.

69
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:36,480
It's hard to see because of the lips but 
the tip of the tongue is still forward.

70
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,640
Notice that the lips are relaxed.

71
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,760
The word ‘recall’. The dark part is made with 
the back of the tongue as the jaw closes.

72
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:51,840
This time the Dark L does end 
with the second part the Light L.

73
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,280
The tongue tip quickly comes through the teeth.

74
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,440
Lips are relaxed.

75
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,560
The relaxation of the lips 
is important in the Dark L.

76
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,720
Many non-native speakers want to round or  

77
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,880
flare the lips which brings the 
sound forward and changes it.

78
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,560
But the dark sound is made back here.

79
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:20,320
Leave the lips relaxed so the sound 
can be made in the back of the mouth.

80
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:27,920
When you look at the International Phonetic 
Alphabet transcription for a word in a dictionary,

81
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:32,240
you'll just see one symbol whether 
it's a Light L or a Dark L.

82
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:36,800
It's up to you to know when to make a Dark L.

83
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,880
when the L comes at the end of a syllable.

84
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,440
Remember we're talking about 
sounds and not letters.

85
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:49,200
In the example, ‘Google’, you 
see the letter E after the L.

86
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:55,280
E is a vowel but when you look at the 
phonetic transcription of the word,

87
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,080
the last sound is the L.

88
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:02,240
So the L in ‘Google’ is a Dark L.

89
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,840
ull— ull— Google—

90
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:13,600
If you integrate a good Dark L into your 
speech, it will help you sound more American.

91
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,240
The Light L.

92
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:17,760
Black—

93
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:19,760
Slow—

94
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,400
The Dark L.

95
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,160
Feel—

96
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,400
Recall—

97
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,880
Example words. Repeat with me.

98
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:37,040
Love. ull— Love.

99
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:45,200
Hello. ull— Hello.

100
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:53,440
Flat. ull— Flat.

101
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:01,280
Feel. ull— Feel.

102
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:11,840
Table. ull— Table.

103
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:17,600
People. ull— People.
