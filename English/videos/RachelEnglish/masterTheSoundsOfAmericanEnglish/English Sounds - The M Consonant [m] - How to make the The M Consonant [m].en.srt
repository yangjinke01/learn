00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,940
In this American English Pronunciation video,

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:08,240
we're going to learn how to make the M consonant sound.

3
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:20,820
This sound is simply made by pressing the lips together lightly.

4
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:25,300
Mmm-- while making a sound with the vocal cords.

5
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:31,020
So this is a voiced consonant. Mmm---

6
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:36,900
The teeth may begin to part a little in preparation for the next sound.

7
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:38,520
Mm---

8
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,180
Which will pull the lips a little bit.

9
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:45,120
Mmm----

10
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:52,480
Because the soft palate is lowered, air comes up through the nasal passages.

11
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,520
This makes it a nasal consonant.

12
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,780
You can feel the vibration in your nose.

13
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:01,960
Mmm---

14
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:06,440
There are only 3 nasal sounds in American English.

15
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,000
Nn---

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,300
Ng--

17
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,680
Mmm---

18
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:17,740
Let's look at this sound up close and in slow motion.

19
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:20,160
The word 'mom'.

20
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:24,580
Lips pressed together as the jaw drops a little bit.

21
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:27,260
Another M at the end.

22
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:31,100
Lips pressed together. Summer.

23
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:34,920
Lips pressed together.

24
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,500
The M consonant.

25
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,600
Mom.

26
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,980
Summer.

27
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:46,040
Example words. Repeat with me.

28
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,700
Make.

29
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:54,360
Mm--- Make.

30
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,920
My.

31
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:02,160
Mm--- My.

32
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,540
Forming.

33
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:10,780
Mm--- forming.

34
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:13,380
Dim.

35
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:19,800
Mm--- dim.

36
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,320
Mistake.

37
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:27,120
Mm-- mistake.

38
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,760
Game.

39
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,000
Mm-- game.

40
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,460
This video is one of 36 in a new series, The Sounds of American English.

41
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:45,560
Videos in this set will be released here on YouTube twice a month,

42
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:50,860
first and third Thursdays, in 2016 and 2017.

43
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:55,280
But the  whole set can be all yours right now.

44
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:01,000
The real value of these videos is watching them as a set, as a whole,

45
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,160
to give your mind the time to take it all in and get the bigger picture.

46
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:12,560
Most of the materials you'll find elsewhere just teach the sounds on their own in isolation.

47
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,640
It's a mistake to learn them this way.

48
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:21,380
We learn the sounds to speak words and sentences, not just sounds.

49
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:24,980
Move closer to fluency in spoken English.
