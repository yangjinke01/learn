00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:07,760
In this American English pronunciation video 
we're going to learn how to make the two th sounds.

2
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,200
These sounds are paired together because they take the same mouth position.

3
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:28,023
TH is unvoiced meaning only air passes through the mouth TH and TH

4
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,000
is voiced meaning you make a sound with the vocal cords.

5
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:44,320
The very tip of the tongue comes through the teeth.
The air passes around the tongue. The tongue is  

6
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:51,000
relaxed. There shouldn't be any pressure in 
the mouth or a stop quality to this sound.

7
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,508
Just nice and easy.

8
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:05,290
The tongue has to easily vibrate between the 
teeth so keep the tongue soft and relaxed.

9
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:17,280
The lips don't affect this sound so they can 
be transitioning to the next sound. For example  

10
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:24,550
in the thr cluster the lips will round a 
little bit for the r as you make the th  

11
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:35,200
Three, three. Be careful with the tongue tip.
Make sure it doesn't come too far forward. 

12
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:42,160
It's just the very tip that should come 
between the teeth to make the unvoiced th,

13
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:45,567
the tongue tip absolutely has to come through the teeth.  

14
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:58,720
But the voiced th can be different. When it's 
in an unstressed quick word like these or the  

15
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:06,320
The tongue tip doesn't have to come through the 
teeth. It can press behind the teeth make sure  

16
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:13,278
the tongue isn't at the roof of the mouth or 
pointing down but pressing right in the middle

17
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:20,880
where the teeth come together. If it's not in the right position the sound will be wrong.

18
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:35,920
This tongue shortcut works in these words because 
they're unstressed so when you don't bring your  

19
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:43,465
tongue tip through the teeth it allows you to 
make these less important words quickly. These,  

20
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:51,680
the. Let's look at these sounds up close 
and in slow motion. Notice how it's just  

21
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:58,160
the very tip that comes out of the teeth. 
The tongue is relaxed the teeth surround it  

22
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:08,320
but they're not clamping down on it. The lips 
and face are relaxed throw notice how the lips  

23
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:14,521
are starting to flare for the r as the tongue 
comes through the teeth for the unvoiced th.

24
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:23,600
Birthday. Keep in mind when you only stick the 
very tip of your tongue out the movement into  

25

Watch the tongue tip come in and flip up for the d.  

26
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:38,320
This is a quick move of the tongue that you can 
practice over and over to make it more natural.
