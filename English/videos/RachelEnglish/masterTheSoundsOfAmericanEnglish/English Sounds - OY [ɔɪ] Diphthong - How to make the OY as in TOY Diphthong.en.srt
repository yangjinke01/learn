00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:03,940
In this American English pronunciation video,

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:09,440
we’re going to learn how to pronounce
the OY as in TOY diphthong.

3
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:23,840
Diphthongs are a combination of two sounds, so they have a starting position and an ending position.

4
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:30,099
This dipthtong begins with the AW as in LAW [ɔ] vowel.

5
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:36,720
As a part of the diphthong, the lips round more
than they do for the pure vowel by itself,

6
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:40,320
like in the word ‘law’.

7
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,840
Oy.

8
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:49,140
The tongue is slightly lifted and shifted a bit back,
so the tip of the tongue is not touching anything.

9
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:54,000
The ending position is the 'ih' as in 'sit' vowel.

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
The lips relax and the tongue comes forward.

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,020
The tip lightly touches the back of the bottom front teeth,

12
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:05,640
and the top, front part of the tongue arches up towards the roof of the mouth.

13
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,460
This brings the jaw back up.

14
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:13,540
Let’s look at this sound up close and in slow motion.

15
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:17,140
At the beginning of the diphthong, the lips are rounded.

16
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:22,760
The space inside the mouth is dark 
because the tongue has shifted back.

17
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:27,400
For the second position, the corners of the lips have relaxed out

18
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:32,280
and the front, top part of tongue reaches up
towards the roof of the mouth.

19
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,180
There is still some jaw drop.

20
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:40,380
Here’s the word ‘toy’. Again, lips round for the first sound,

21
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:47,820
and relax for the second sound as the tongue arches towards the roof of the mouth in the front.

22
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:53,400
In a stressed syllable, the OY diphthong curves up then down.

23
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:57,200
Toy. OY.

24
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:04,760
In an unstressed syllable, it’s lower and
flatter in pitch, as well as quieter and quicker

25
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:08,000
Oy- oy-

26
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,800
The diphthong is unstressed in the word ‘tabloid’.

27
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,480
Oy-

28
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,140
Let’s take a look at this word.

29
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:22,080
The diphthong looks the same:
lips rounded for the beginning position,

30
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,920
then relaxing out for the ending position, before the tongue tip flips up for the D.

31
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:36,780
But because the pitch is flatter and the
syllable is quicker, it sounds unstressed.

32
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:40,520
The OY diphthong, stressed:

33
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:44,840
Toy. OY.

34
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,320
Unstressed:

35
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:51,340
Tabloid. Oy-

36
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:59,880
OY, oy, OY, oy.

37
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:04,660
Example words. Repeat with me:

38
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:13,840
Oil. OY- Oil.

39
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:21,840
Coin. OY- Coin.

40
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:29,380
Joyful. OY- Joyful.

41
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:37,600
Steroid. oy- Steroid.

42
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:45,520
Loyal. oy- Loyal.

43
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:51,856
Boy
