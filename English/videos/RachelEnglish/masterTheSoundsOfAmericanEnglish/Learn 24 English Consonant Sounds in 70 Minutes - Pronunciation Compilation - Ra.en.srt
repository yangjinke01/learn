00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:05,740
Get better clarity with your spoken English
by fully understanding all the consonant sounds

2
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:07,990
we have in American English.

3
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:12,780
Today is a compilation of every single consonant
sound you need to know.

4
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:14,090
Some will be easy for you.

5
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:16,180
You have them in your own native language.

6
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:16,890
Great!

7
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:18,225
Just practice the words.

8
00:00:18,225 --> 00:00:20,810
Others will be tricky, unfamiliar.

9
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:26,169
Use the photos to study the position and the
up-close slow motion shots.

10
00:00:26,169 --> 00:00:30,159
This will help make it clear, for example,
how much of the tongue tip needs to come through

11
00:00:30,159 --> 00:00:31,840
the teeth for the th.

12
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,620
It’s not much.

13
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:35,070
Why not start with the th?

14
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:36,431
Let’s dive in.

15
00:00:36,431 --> 00:00:42,120
These sounds are paired together because they
take the same mouth position.

16
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:52,539
TH is unvoiced, meaning, only air passes through
the mouth, and TH is voiced, meaning you make

17
00:00:52,539 --> 00:00:58,789
a sound with the vocal cords, th, th.

18
00:00:58,789 --> 00:01:02,280
The very tip of the tongue comes through the
teeth.

19
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,339
The air passes around the tongue.

20
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:06,850
The tongue is relaxed.

21
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:14,710
There shouldn’t be any pressure in the mouth,
or a stop quality to this sound.

22
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:20,479
Just nice and easy, th, th.

23
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:28,400
The tongue has to easily vibrate between the
teeth, so keep the tongue soft and relaxed.

24
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,729
Th, th.

25
00:01:31,729 --> 00:01:38,070
The lips don’t affect the sound, so they
can be transitioning to the next sound.

26
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:45,070
For example, in the THR cluster, the lips
will round a little bit for the R as you make

27
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:51,659
the TH: three, three.

28
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:54,240
Be careful with the tongue tip.

29
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,649
Make sure it doesn’t come too far forward;
it’s just the very tip that should come

30
00:01:59,649 --> 00:02:01,840
between the teeth.

31
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:10,656
To make the unvoiced TH, the tongue tip absolutely
has to come through the teeth, th, th.

32
00:02:10,656 --> 00:02:14,120
But the voiced TH can be different.

33
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:22,920
When it’s in an unstressed, quick word like
‘these’ or ‘the’, the tongue tip doesn’t

34
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,150
have to come through the teeth.

35
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:27,670
It can press behind the teeth.

36
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:33,720
Make sure the tongue isn’t at the roof of
the mouth, or pointing down, but pressing

37
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:40,238
right in the middle, where the teeth come
together.

38
00:02:40,238 --> 00:02:44,830
If it’s not in the right position, the sound
will be wrong.

39
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:51,060
Th, th, these, the.

40
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:56,339
This tongue shortcut works in these words
because they’re unstressed.

41
00:02:56,339 --> 00:03:01,230
So when you don’t bring your tongue tip
through the teeth, it allows you to make these

42
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:04,080
less important words quickly.

43
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,569
These, the.

44
00:03:07,569 --> 00:03:12,000
Let’s look at these sounds up close and
in slow motion.

45
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,010
Notice how it’s just the very tip that comes
out of the teeth.

46
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:18,790
The tongue is relaxed.

47
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:23,569
The teeth surround it, but they’re not clamping
down on it.

48
00:03:23,569 --> 00:03:26,540
The lips and face are relaxed.

49
00:03:27,169 --> 00:03:28,198
Throw.

50
00:03:28,198 --> 00:03:33,590
Notice how the lips are starting to flare
for the R as the tongue comes through the

51
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:37,032
teeth for the unvoiced TH.

52
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:40,049
Birthday.

53
00:03:40,049 --> 00:03:45,379
Keep in mind when you only stick the very
tip of your tongue out, the movement into

54
00:03:45,379 --> 00:03:48,950
other sounds isn’t as hard as you might
think.

55
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:52,866
Watch the tongue tip come in and flip up for
the D.

56
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:59,790
This is a quick move of the tongue that you
can practice over and over to make it more

57
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:00,833
natural.

58
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:03,230
Brother.

59
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:07,010
Tongue tip through the teeth for the voiced
TH.

60
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:09,236
Lips and tongue are relaxed.

61
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:15,080
Worth, ending in the unvoiced TH.

62
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:19,637
Again, the lips and tongue look very relaxed.

63
00:04:21,184 --> 00:04:26,662
Remember to keep your tongue relaxed and soft
when you practice this sound.

64
00:04:27,436 --> 00:04:41,591
The voiced and unvoiced TH: throw, birthday,
brother, worth.

65
00:04:41,591 --> 00:04:43,600
Example words.

66
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,000
Repeat with me.

67
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:52,893
Other

68
00:04:52,893 --> 00:05:01,528
Either

69
00:05:01,528 --> 00:05:09,589
Though

70
00:05:09,589 --> 00:05:17,608
Thursday

71
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:25,101
Nothing

72
00:05:25,101 --> 00:05:31,800
South

73
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:36,250
The R in American English is also such a tough
sound for my students to get.

74
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:39,740
Here’s the thing, most people needs to simplify.

75
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,690
Do less with the tongue.

76
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:45,410
Maybe round the lips a little bit more but
take out tension.

77
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:46,578
Take a look.

78
00:05:46,578 --> 00:05:51,234
This is truly one of the hardest sounds in
American English.

79
00:05:51,234 --> 00:05:57,083
Before I go into how to make it, I want to
talk about how not to make it.

80
00:05:57,083 --> 00:06:03,590
In many languages, the R is made by bouncing
the front part of the tongue against the roof

81
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:07,838
of the mouth, rr, rr.

82
00:06:07,838 --> 00:06:15,350
In American English, this sound of the T or
D between vowels, but it’s quite different

83
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:20,290
from the American R, rr.

84
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:30,510
You can’t hold out rr, rr, but you should
be able to hold out the American R, rr.

85
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:33,840
This consonant is voiced.

86
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,870
There are two ways to make this sound.

87
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:47,690
In the first way, the front part of the tongue
pulls back and up, like this.

88
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:53,490
The tongue can be stretched so it’s long
and skinny, or it can be pulled into itself

89
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:56,220
so it’s fatter and thicker.

90
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:58,030
And that’s what we want here.

91
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:03,410
We’re making the tongue fatter and thicker
so it’s not as long.

92
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:05,220
The back doesn’t move.

93
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:09,560
This is happening with the front and middle
of the tongue.

94
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:13,500
The middle part of the tongue lifts up towards
the roof of the mouth.

95
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:19,370
You can touch the sides of the tongue to the
sides of the roof of the mouth here, or to

96
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:24,060
the inside or bottom of the side teeth, here.

97
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:30,830
The front part of the tongue is hanging in
the middle of the mouth, not touching anything.

98
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:36,400
This sound is forward and focused because
of the position of the lips.

99
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,220
The corners come in, pushing the lips away
from the face.

100
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:47,340
This lip position will be a little more relaxed
when the R comes at the end of a syllable.

101
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:54,900
We’ll compare this way, on the left, with
the other way to make an R on the right.

102
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:59,330
The R can also be made by flipping the tongue
tip up.

103
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:01,900
The lips flare the same way.

104
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:07,290
Some native speakers make the R one way, and
some the other.

105
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:12,280
Native speakers get the correct sound, no
matter the mouth position.

106
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:19,140
But I’ve found that non-native speakers
drop the jaw too much in this second method,

107
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:23,678
and it makes the sound hollow, rr.

108
00:08:23,678 --> 00:08:32,060
The jaw doesn’t need to drop very much for
this sound, rr, so keep this in mind as you

109
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:35,401
work on one of these two methods.

110
00:08:35,401 --> 00:08:40,470
Here is the R sound on its own, not part of
a word.

111
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:42,030
You can see the lips flare.

112
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:48,195
Think of creating a little space between the
inside of your lips and your teeth.

113
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:51,400
Notice how little jaw drop there is.

114
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:56,770
We don’t need to drop the jaw to pull the
tongue back and up.

115
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:58,960
The word ‘rest’.

116
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:05,060
When the R is at the beginning of a word,
we tend to make the lips a tight circle.

117
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:11,233
Again, little jaw drop as the middle of the
tongue lifts to the roof of the mouth.

118
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,590
The word ‘proud’.

119
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:22,970
When R is in a beginning consonant cluster,
the lips may not be as tight as in a beginning

120
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:24,050
R.

121
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,520
The word ‘mother’.

122
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:34,120
At the end of a syllable, the lip position
for the R is definitely more relaxed than

123
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:37,536
a beginning R, but the lips still flare.

124
00:09:39,035 --> 00:09:45,930
Here, we compare the lip position of the beginning
R in ‘rest’, above, to the ending R in

125
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:48,430
‘mother’, below.

126
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:53,500
The ending R lip position is much more relaxed.

127
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:58,130
Thinking about the lip position will help
you make a better R sound.

128
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:04,560
As you work on this consonant, practice very
slowly, thinking about all three things at

129
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,890
once.

130
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:11,200
Very little jaw drop, the tongue position,
and the lip position.

131
00:10:11,587 --> 00:10:21,170
Remember, you can hold out this sound, so
that’s how you want to practice it, rrrr.

132
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:28,360
Hold it out for 5 or 10 seconds; hold it out
as long as you can.

133
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,539
When you practice it in a word, do the same.

134
00:10:31,539 --> 00:10:42,672
Rrrrrrrest, prrrrrroud, motherrrrrr.

135
00:10:43,737 --> 00:10:51,471
The R sound: rest, proud, mother.

136
00:10:51,954 --> 00:10:54,300
Example words.

137
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,736
Repeat with me:

138
00:10:56,736 --> 00:11:03,250
Read

139
00:11:04,427 --> 00:11:11,500
Great

140
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:19,497
Try

141
00:11:19,497 --> 00:11:27,408
Later

142
00:11:27,408 --> 00:11:35,476
Right

143
00:11:35,476 --> 00:11:42,876
Other

144
00:11:42,876 --> 00:11:47,979
And now, back to back you’ll see all the
other consonant sounds in American English.

145
00:11:47,979 --> 00:11:53,600
We’re going to start with the pairs like
TH where there are two sounds together because

146
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:58,250
one is voiced and the other is unvoiced but
they have the same mouth position.

147
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:01,084
Then we’ll get in to single sounds like
R.

148
00:12:01,084 --> 00:12:04,793
The P and B consonants. 

149
00:12:04,793 --> 00:12:10,560
These two sounds are paired together because
they take the same mouth position.

150
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:18,180
P is unvoiced, pp, meaning only air passes
through the mouth.

151
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:27,821
And B is voiced, bb, meaning, you make a sound
with the vocal cords, bb.

152
00:12:27,821 --> 00:12:31,779
The lips stay together while the teeth part
a little.

153
00:12:31,779 --> 00:12:37,000
The tongue position doesn’t matter for these
consonants, so the tongue can start to get

154
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,220
into position for the next sound.

155
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:48,770
For example, if the next sound is the R consonant,
the tongue can move back and up for the R

156
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:53,660
while the lips close for the B, bring.

157
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:58,850
Let’s see the sounds up close and in slow
motion.

158
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:05,200
The lips press together, and then release.

159
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,260
These are stop consonants.

160
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:10,830
In stop consonants, there are two parts.

161
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:14,460
There is a stop of the airflow, and a release.

162
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:22,040
The stop of the airflow happens as the lips
close: hap-pen.

163
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:33,420
The release is when the lips part and the
air comes through, -pen, hap-pen, happen.

164
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:38,420
Sometimes native speakers don’t release
stop consonants when they come at the end

165
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:44,029
of a sentence, or when the next word begins
with a consonant.

166
00:13:44,029 --> 00:13:48,740
For example, the common phrase ‘What’s
up?’.

167
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:53,630
My lips closed in the P position, but I didn’t
release the air.

168
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:55,683
What’s up?

169
00:13:55,683 --> 00:14:00,000
Another example: nap time!

170
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,210
Nap---time!

171
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:08,850
My lips came together for the P, but they
didn’t release the air.

172
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:16,100
I stopped the air with my lips, then released
it with the next sound, the T consonant.

173
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,930
Nap time.

174
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:22,710
Let’s look at some words up close and in
slow motion.

175
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:24,750
The word ‘best’.

176
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:32,050
The lips press together, and then release
into the EH as in BED vowel.

177
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:34,220
The word ‘spot’.

178
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:41,640
The lips press together, and then release
into the AH as in FATHER vowel.

179
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,350
The word ‘rip’.

180
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:49,160
The lips press together, and then release.

181
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:59,039
The P and B consonants: best, spot, rip.

182
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:01,190
Example words.

183
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:03,261
Repeat with me:

184
00:15:03,261 --> 00:15:10,356
Bring

185
00:15:10,356 --> 00:15:18,060
Baby

186
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:26,620
Job

187
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:33,257
Peace

188
00:15:33,257 --> 00:15:41,698
Price

189
00:15:41,698 --> 00:15:47,668
Up

190
00:15:47,668 --> 00:15:53,320
CH and JJ consonants.

191
00:15:53,320 --> 00:16:01,790
The CH and JJ consonants are paired together
because they take the same mouth position.

192
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:11,690
Ch is unvoiced, meaning only air passes through
the mouth, and jj is voiced, meaning, you

193
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:16,520
make a sound with the vocal cords, jj.

194
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:23,100
These consonants have a stop consonant component,
but unlike stop consonants, they're always

195
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,610
released.

196
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:35,980
They each contain two sounds: for the CH,
we’re combining the T, tt, and the SH, sh,

197
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:39,540
to make ch.

198
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:49,020
For the J sound, we’re combining dd and
zh to make jj.

199
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:56,360
The teeth come together and the lips flair,
just like in the sh and zh sounds.

200
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:03,140
But the tongue position is like the tt and
dd sounds.

201
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:09,630
The tongue lifts so the front, flat part of
the tongue touches the roof of the mouth.

202
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:18,640
We stop the air in our throat, and then we
release everything, ch, jj.

203
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:26,059
We release the air at the vocal cords, release
the tongue down from the roof of the mouth,

204
00:17:26,059 --> 00:17:33,090
release the teeth so they part a little, and
release the lips by relaxing them.

205
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:35,990
Ch, jj.

206
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:41,470
Let’s look at these sounds up close and
in slow motion.

207
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:45,140
The lips flare and the teeth come together.

208
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:47,429
Then the release.

209
00:17:47,429 --> 00:17:49,650
The word ‘jar’.

210
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:57,650
The lips flare and the teeth come together,
then release into the AH as in FATHER vowel.

211
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:59,990
The word ‘chart’.

212
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:09,150
The lips flare and the teeth come together,
then release into the AH as in FATHER vowel.

213
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:10,990
The word ‘batch’.

214
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:16,710
The lips flare and the teeth come together,
then release.

215
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:22,476
The CH and JJ consonants.

216
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:29,136
Jar, chart, batch.

217
00:18:29,136 --> 00:18:31,781
Example words.

218
00:18:31,781 --> 00:18:33,852
Practice with me:

219
00:18:33,852 --> 00:18:41,914
Chase

220
00:18:41,914 --> 00:18:50,527
Attach

221
00:18:50,527 --> 00:18:58,008
Teacher

222
00:18:58,008 --> 00:19:05,744
Danger

223
00:19:05,744 --> 00:19:12,790
Just

224
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:20,126
General

225
00:19:20,126 --> 00:19:25,490
The T and D consonant sounds.

226
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:30,850
These two sounds are paired together because
they take the same mouth position.

227
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:37,020
Tt is unvoiced, meaning, only air passes through
the mouth.

228
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:46,760
And dd is voiced, meaning, dd, you make a
sound with the vocal cords.

229
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:52,600
These consonants are complicated because the
way Americans pronounce them isn’t always

230
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,690
what you’ll find in a dictionary.

231
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:59,850
First, let’s talk about the true pronunciation.

232
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:04,020
These are stop consonants, which means there
are two parts.

233
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:09,740
First, a stop in the airflow, and second,
a release.

234
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:16,850
We stop here, by closing our vocal cords,
and lift the tongue so the flat, top part

235
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:18,440
is at the roof of the mouth.

236
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:24,130
It’s far forward, almost touching the back
of the top front teeth.

237
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:30,120
The teeth come together, and we release all
three parts at once: the tongue comes down

238
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:37,830
from the roof of the mouth, the teeth part,
and we release the air in the throat.

239
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:41,267
TT, DD.

240
00:20:41,267 --> 00:20:47,560
Just like with other stop consonants, we want
to release them into the next sound.

241
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:54,720
Let’s look at the True T and D consonants
up close and in slow motion.

242
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:59,930
The teeth come together and the top, front
of the tongue is at the roof of the mouth.

243
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:01,929
The air stops in the throat.

244
00:21:01,929 --> 00:21:07,160
Then, the teeth part and the tongue pulls
down to release.

245
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,170
The word ‘desk’.

246
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:12,780
The teeth close and the tongue is at the roof
of the mouth.

247
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:20,620
Then, everything releases right into the EH
as in BED vowel.

248
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:22,620
The word ‘stick’.

249
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:26,160
The teeth close and the tongue is at the roof
of the mouth.

250
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:33,900
Then, everything releases right into the IH
as in SIT vowel.

251
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:40,580
The word ‘expect’: the teeth nearly close
and the tongue is at the roof of the mouth.

252
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:43,510
Then the teeth release just a bit.

253
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:50,110
There’s no next sound to release into, so
the movement is minimal for the release.

254
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:52,660
The tongue releases down.

255
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:59,600
It’s possible to make the True D without
the teeth coming together.

256
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:04,670
Said, dd, dd.

257
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:09,120
Because of the voice in this sound, we can
still release it.

258
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,040
Said, dd.

259
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:20,124
But to make the True T, the teeth do have
to come together or nearly together, set,

260
00:22:20,124 --> 00:22:22,656
tt.

261
00:22:22,656 --> 00:22:31,130
That was the True T and True D. If the T or
D are at the end of a sentence, or if the

262
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:37,890
next word begins with a consonant, then we
make a Stop T or Stop D.

263
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:41,840
We stop the air, but we don’t release it.

264
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:48,240
You lift your tongue into position, stop the
air, and that’s it.

265
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:53,070
For example, the word ‘mad’, dd.

266
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:56,025
Mad, dd.

267
00:22:56,025 --> 00:23:07,221
Notice the last sound is dd, the beginning
of the D, with the vocal cords engaged, because

268
00:23:07,221 --> 00:23:09,510
it’s a voiced consonant.

269
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:10,770
And that’s all.

270
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:12,610
I don’t release.

271
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:18,360
A release would sound like this: mad, dd.

272
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:24,780
But instead, I say ‘mad’, leaving my tongue
tip up.

273
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:32,253
Now let’s look at an example with a T followed
by another consonant, the phrase ‘not for

274
00:23:32,253 --> 00:23:33,843
me’.

275
00:23:33,843 --> 00:23:42,420
Here the T is followed by F. I stop the air,
‘not’, and then, without releasing, go

276
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,540
into the F sound.

277
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:48,113
Not for, not for me.

278
00:23:48,113 --> 00:23:52,656
With stop consonants, we do stop the air in
the throat.

279
00:23:52,656 --> 00:23:59,100
So I don’t have to move my tongue up into
position for the T to stop the sound.

280
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:04,960
In this phrase ‘not for me’, I touch the
roof of my mouth with a part of the tongue

281
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,839
that’s further back.

282
00:24:06,839 --> 00:24:08,669
Not.

283
00:24:10,555 --> 00:24:13,919
My tongue tip can stay down.

284
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:20,026
This helps me make the stop even shorter,
so I can quickly go into the next sound, not

285
00:24:20,026 --> 00:24:23,070
for, not for.

286
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:29,600
I’ll bring my tongue up for the Stop T if
the next sound also requires the tongue being

287
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,370
at the roof of the mouth.

288
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:40,470
When I say ‘not for me’ instead of ‘noT
for me’, the words are more connected and

289
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:41,860
the sentence is smoother.

290
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:45,590
That’s what we want in American English.

291
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:51,830
And that’s why we use the Stop T instead
of the True T in these cases.

292
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:53,500
Not for me.

293
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,840
NoT for me.

294
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,360
Not for me.

295
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:02,709
Let’s look at a stop up close and in slow
motion.

296
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:04,630
Here is the word ‘what’.

297
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:08,350
I don’t release the T at the end.

298
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:13,740
The tongue goes to the roof of the mouth,
but then I just stop the air.

299
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:17,380
My teeth aren’t together, and I don’t
release.

300
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:21,892
The lips simply close, what.

301
00:25:21,892 --> 00:25:29,584
Here’s what it looks like with a True T:
The teeth come together, then a subtle release.

302
00:25:29,584 --> 00:25:31,410
Compare the ending.

303
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:38,100
The top is ‘what’ with a Stop T, and the
bottom is ‘what’, with a True T.

304
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:43,720
For the Stop T, the teeth don’t come together,
because they don’t need to release.

305
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:47,330
The air simply stops with the tongue in position.

306
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:55,960
For the True T, we bring the teeth together
so the tongue, teeth, and air release.

307
00:25:55,960 --> 00:26:00,570
The Stop T and D relate to the True T and
D.

308
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:02,810
We simply skip the release.

309
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:10,059
But when the T or D come between two vowels
or diphthongs, or after an R and before a

310
00:26:10,059 --> 00:26:14,290
vowel or diphthong, we make a different sound.

311
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:19,333
One exception: if the T or D starts a stressed
syllable.

312
00:26:19,333 --> 00:26:27,840
Then it’s a True T or D. But in other cases,
when the T or D consonants come between two

313
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:35,636
vowels or diphthongs, or after an R and before
a vowel or diphthong, we make a Flap sound.

314
00:26:35,636 --> 00:26:42,160
This is different from the True and Stop T
and D, because we don’t stop the sound.

315
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,710
We don’t hold anything.

316
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:50,030
We simply let the front part of the tongue
bounce against the roof of the mouth without

317
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:52,730
stopping the flow of air.

318
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:57,040
The Flap T and Flap D sound the same.

319
00:26:57,040 --> 00:27:03,440
The T in ‘matter’ is the same as the D
in ‘madder’.

320
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:07,760
Matter, madder.

321
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:14,220
This sounds just like the R in many languages,
but in American English, it’s the Flap T

322
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:16,360
or Flap D.

323
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:20,710
In my videos, I use the D symbol for this
sound.

324
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:24,550
This sound, however, isn’t a stop consonant
anymore.

325
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:30,600
Let’s look at some words with a Flap up
close and in slow motion.

326
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,419
The word ‘city’.

327
00:27:32,419 --> 00:27:36,669
Here the T comes between two vowel sounds,
so it’s a Flap.

328
00:27:36,669 --> 00:27:40,710
The tongue is in position for the IH vowel.

329
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:44,580
Watch how it flaps against the roof of the
mouth quickly.

330
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:47,160
The air doesn’t stop.

331
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:50,559
That Flap was fast, even in slow motion.

332
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:54,860
Let’s watch again.

333
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:58,240
The whole word, one more time.

334
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:01,620
The word ‘party’.

335
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:06,480
Here the T comes after an R and before a vowel,
so it’s a Flap.

336
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:14,520
The tongue is back and up for the R. Watch
it flap and come down from the flap.

337
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,760
The air didn’t stop.

338
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:19,707
Watch the whole word one more time.

339
00:28:21,061 --> 00:28:23,400
The word ‘tidy’.

340
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:30,130
Here the D comes after a diphthong and before
a vowel, so it’s a Flap D. Watch the tongue

341
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:32,420
flap.

342
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:35,305
The whole word, one more time.

343
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:47,938
To isolate the sound, try holding out the
sound before and after: parrrrrrtyyyyy.

344
00:28:47,938 --> 00:28:53,840
Then you can really feel the tongue flap,
bouncing against the roof of the mouth.

345
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:57,717
Remember, this isn’t represented in dictionaries.

346
00:28:57,717 --> 00:29:03,789
They will show the symbol for the True T,
‘parTy’, even though Americans pronounce

347
00:29:03,789 --> 00:29:06,059
it ‘party’.

348
00:29:06,059 --> 00:29:12,610
So remember the rule: when a T or D comes
between vowels and diphthongs, or after an

349
00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:20,698
R before a vowel or diphthong, like ‘party’,
unless it starts a stressed syllable, flap

350
00:29:20,698 --> 00:29:22,101
the tongue.

351
00:29:23,359 --> 00:29:27,049
Sometimes, we drop the T or D completely.

352
00:29:27,049 --> 00:29:29,370
We leave the sounds out.

353
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:31,500
This is an American habit.

354
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:35,950
If you look up the words in a dictionary,
the sounds are there.

355
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:41,970
There are two cases when you might hear an
American drop a T or D.

356
00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:47,420
First, when the T or D comes between two consonant
sounds.

357
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:50,700
For example: exactly.

358
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:56,160
This word has the K, T, L consonants together.

359
00:29:56,160 --> 00:30:01,040
But most people pronounce it without the T.
Exactly.

360
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:05,100
Full pronunciation: exactly.

361
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:09,380
Common pronunciation: exactly.

362
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:14,430
Dropping the T between two consonants simplifies
the pronunciation.

363
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:23,460
Also, we often drop the T when it comes after
an N. Many Americans say ‘cenner’ instead

364
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:32,750
of ‘center’, or ‘innerview’ instead
of ‘interview’.

365
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:34,320
This is a big topic.

366
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:43,110
I have a whole series of videos on the pronunciation
of T and D, which you can find on my website.

367
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:53,638
The True T and D sounds: desk, stick, expect

368
00:30:53,638 --> 00:30:56,589
Stop T and D:

369
00:30:56,589 --> 00:31:03,570
mad, not, what

370
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:12,979
The Flap T and D: city, party tidy

371
00:31:12,979 --> 00:31:15,330
Example words.

372
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:16,448
Repeat with me:

373
00:31:16,448 --> 00:31:23,477
Best

374
00:31:23,477 --> 00:31:33,603
Time

375
00:31:33,603 --> 00:31:41,616
Do

376
00:31:41,616 --> 00:31:49,168
Odd

377
00:31:49,168 --> 00:31:55,169
There’s no way to make a Stop T sound on
its own, because it isn’t a sound.

378
00:31:55,169 --> 00:31:57,920
It’s a lack of sound.

379
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:04,493
Cut

380
00:32:04,493 --> 00:32:10,876
Better

381
00:32:10,876 --> 00:32:15,603
The F and V consonants.

382
00:32:15,603 --> 00:32:21,392
These two sounds are paired together because
they take the same mouth position.

383
00:32:21,392 --> 00:32:26,550
Ff is unvoiced, meaning only air passes through
the mouth.

384
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:35,090
And vv is voiced, meaning, you make a sound
with the vocal cords, vv.

385
00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:41,169
To make these sounds, the bottom lip lifts
and touches the very bottom of the top front

386
00:32:41,169 --> 00:32:45,823
teeth, ff, vv.

387
00:32:45,823 --> 00:32:51,940
The top lip lifts a little bit to get out
of the way of the bottom lip.

388
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:58,015
You don't want to see your bottom lip disappear,
ff.

389
00:32:58,015 --> 00:33:10,350
It's actually the inside of the lip, here,
that makes contact with the teeth, ff, vv.

390
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:15,720
The tongue should stay relaxed so the air
can easily push through, causing the bottom

391
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:19,668
lip to vibrate against the top teeth.

392
00:33:19,668 --> 00:33:24,250
Let’s look at the sounds up close and in
slow motion.

393
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:30,250
The top lip lifts so the bottom lip has room
to vibrate against the bottom of the top front

394
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:31,680
teeth.

395
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:38,770
Very: Bottom lip goes to the bottom of the
top front teeth.

396
00:33:38,770 --> 00:33:48,341
Flavor: The bottom lip goes to the top front
teeth for the F, and again for the V.

397
00:33:49,115 --> 00:33:54,977
Enough: bottom lip to top front teeth.

398
00:33:56,626 --> 00:34:02,870
When you work on these consonants and words
with these consonants, watch yourself and

399
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:09,990
make sure your bottom lip doesn’t curl in,
ff, vv.

400
00:34:09,990 --> 00:34:16,659
Remember, it’s the inside of the lip that
makes these sounds.

401
00:34:16,659 --> 00:34:26,175
The V and F consonants: very, flavor, enough.

402
00:34:26,175 --> 00:34:28,579
Example words.

403
00:34:28,579 --> 00:34:30,518
Repeat with me:

404
00:34:30,518 --> 00:34:37,468
Live

405
00:34:38,435 --> 00:34:45,643
Value

406
00:34:45,643 --> 00:34:53,825
Provide

407
00:34:53,825 --> 00:35:02,032
Fresh

408
00:35:02,032 --> 00:35:09,431
Offer

409
00:35:09,431 --> 00:35:16,989
Tough

410
00:35:16,989 --> 00:35:22,130
The G and K consonant sounds.

411
00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:27,410
These two sounds are paired together because
they take the same mouth position.

412
00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:33,960
Kk is unvoiced, meaning, only air passes through
the mouth.

413
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:42,910
and gg is voiced, meaning, you make a sound
with the vocal cords, gg.

414
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:49,140
These consonants are stop consonants, which
means there are two parts to each sound.

415
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:54,650
First, a stop in the airflow, and second,
a release.

416
00:35:54,650 --> 00:36:00,279
We stop the flow of the air here, closing
our vocal cords, while the back part of the

417
00:36:00,279 --> 00:36:03,952
tongue reaches up to touch the soft palate.

418
00:36:03,952 --> 00:36:09,859
I’m going to slow down the K sound in the
word ‘back’.

419
00:36:09,859 --> 00:36:15,010
See if you can hear the stop of air before
the release.

420
00:36:15,010 --> 00:36:18,388
Ba-ck.

421
00:36:18,388 --> 00:36:20,508
Back.

422
00:36:20,508 --> 00:36:23,430
Here, you can see the tongue position.

423
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:28,680
The back of the tongue reaches up to touch
the soft palate, which is closed.

424
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:34,040
The tip of the tongue can remain forward,
lightly touching the back of the bottom front

425
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:36,000
teeth.

426
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:44,372
The jaw drops a little bit, and the lips are
open, kk, gg.

427
00:36:44,372 --> 00:36:49,999
The lip position doesn’t matter for these
sounds, so the lips might start forming the

428
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:54,489
next sound, like in the word ‘great’.

429
00:36:54,489 --> 00:37:05,141
Here the lips can start taking the position
for the R as we make the G: g-, g-, great.

430
00:37:05,141 --> 00:37:10,390
Let’s look at these sounds up close and
in slow motion.

431
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:15,652
The jaw drops and the back of the tongue lifts
to touch the soft palate.

432
00:37:15,652 --> 00:37:18,859
Then the tongue releases.

433
00:37:19,633 --> 00:37:27,220
Sometimes, to make a sentence smoother, the
words more linked together, native speakers

434
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:33,289
will skip the release of a stop consonant
when the next word begins with a consonant.

435
00:37:33,289 --> 00:37:37,406
For example, the phrase “back to work”.

436
00:37:37,406 --> 00:37:41,962
Back to, back---to.

437
00:37:41,962 --> 00:37:49,589
I’m not saying ‘back to’, kk, with a
full release of the K. I’m holding the air

438
00:37:49,589 --> 00:37:56,070
for a fraction of a second with my throat,
making that stop, then I go right into the

439
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:58,680
release of the T consonant.

440
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:01,829
Back to, back to.

441
00:38:01,829 --> 00:38:03,815
Back to work.

442
00:38:03,815 --> 00:38:11,230
Without the release of the K in ‘back’,
the two words flow together more easily, making

443
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:13,319
it smoother.

444
00:38:13,319 --> 00:38:18,769
Notice I do make a light release of the K
in the word ‘work’.

445
00:38:18,769 --> 00:38:20,660
Can you hear it?

446
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:22,845
Back to work.

447
00:38:22,845 --> 00:38:27,349
Let’s look at some words up close and in
slow motion.

448
00:38:27,349 --> 00:38:29,640
The word ‘keep’.

449
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:34,650
Because the tongue lifts at the back, and
does not require much jaw drop, it’s hard

450
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:37,900
to see this sound in this word.

451
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,859
The word ‘green’.

452
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:47,589
The lips round for the G because they need
to round for the next sound, R. The lip position

453
00:38:47,589 --> 00:38:50,540
doesn’t change the G sound.

454
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:55,950
It’s a little easier to see the back of
the tongue move when it’s at the end of

455
00:38:55,950 --> 00:38:58,849
a word like this word, ‘egg’.

456
00:38:58,849 --> 00:39:04,000
The tongue lifts in the back, then releases.

457
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:14,282
The G and K consonants: keep, green, egg.

458
00:39:14,282 --> 00:39:16,390
Example words.

459
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:17,967
Repeat with me:

460
00:39:17,967 --> 00:39:24,854
Go

461
00:39:25,918 --> 00:39:33,295
Again

462
00:39:33,295 --> 00:39:40,002
Big

463
00:39:40,002 --> 00:39:48,926
Cry

464
00:39:48,926 --> 00:39:56,553
Key

465
00:39:56,553 --> 00:40:03,334
Black

466
00:40:03,334 --> 00:40:08,476
The S and Z consonant sounds.

467
00:40:08,476 --> 00:40:14,180
These two sounds are paired together because
they take the same mouth position.

468
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:24,799
SS is unvoiced, meaning only air passes through
the mouth, and ZZ is voiced, meaning you make

469
00:40:24,799 --> 00:40:29,680
a sound with the vocal cords, zz.

470
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:35,009
To make the sounds, the lips part and the
corners pull back a little while the teeth

471
00:40:35,009 --> 00:40:42,220
themselves lightly touch, ss, zz.

472
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:44,910
There are two ways to make these sounds.

473
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:51,420
One, with the tip of the tongue down, lightly
touching the back of the bottom front teeth.

474
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:56,459
Or, by pointing the tip of the tongue up.

475
00:40:56,459 --> 00:41:02,969
You may find that the position of the tongue
tip depends on the sounds around the S and

476
00:41:02,969 --> 00:41:03,969
Z.

477
00:41:03,969 --> 00:41:09,269
Let’s look at these sounds up close and
in slow motion.

478
00:41:09,269 --> 00:41:15,099
The teeth lightly touch, tongue tip is down,
and you can see a lot of the tongue through

479
00:41:15,099 --> 00:41:16,579
the teeth.

480
00:41:16,966 --> 00:41:18,337
Sip.

481
00:41:18,337 --> 00:41:25,180
Again, teeth lightly touch, the tongue tip
is pointed down.

482
00:41:26,051 --> 00:41:27,319
Miss.

483
00:41:27,319 --> 00:41:31,923
The tongue tip stays down as the teeth come
together.

484
00:41:34,729 --> 00:41:36,151
Fizz.

485
00:41:36,151 --> 00:41:42,029
This time, you’ll see the tongue tip point
up before the teeth close.

486
00:41:42,029 --> 00:41:43,639
And up.

487
00:41:47,334 --> 00:41:56,512
The S and Z sounds: sip, miss, fizz.

488
00:41:56,512 --> 00:41:58,559
Example words.

489
00:41:58,559 --> 00:41:59,779
Repeat with me.

490
00:41:59,779 --> 00:42:04,680
Note: the letter S can make the [z] sound.

491
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:11,078
Some

492
00:42:11,755 --> 00:42:18,761
Must

493
00:42:19,438 --> 00:42:27,210
Less

494
00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:34,942
Zip

495
00:42:34,942 --> 00:42:41,598
Cousin

496
00:42:42,275 --> 00:42:49,029
Easy

497
00:42:49,029 --> 00:42:54,549
The SH and ZH consonant sounds.

498
00:42:54,549 --> 00:42:59,640
These two sounds are paired together because
they take the same mouth position.

499
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:05,940
SH is unvoiced, meaning only air passes through
the mouth.

500
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:14,469
And ZH is voiced, meaning you make a sound
with the vocal cords, zh.

501
00:43:14,469 --> 00:43:17,559
To make these sounds, the teeth come together.

502
00:43:17,559 --> 00:43:21,229
The corners of the lips come in and the lips
flare.

503
00:43:21,229 --> 00:43:26,579
The tongue lifts so the front/middle part
of the tongue is very close to the roof of

504
00:43:26,579 --> 00:43:29,579
the mouth, but not touching it.

505
00:43:29,579 --> 00:43:34,460
The tongue tip points forward but doesn’t
touch anything.

506
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:39,329
Let’s look at these sounds up close and
in slow motion.

507
00:43:39,329 --> 00:43:42,334
The lips flare and the teeth come together.

508
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:53,509
In the word ‘shop’, the ‘sh’ is at
the beginning of the word.

509
00:43:53,509 --> 00:43:57,207
In the word ‘wish’, it’s at the end.

510
00:43:59,432 --> 00:44:05,995
In the word ‘Asia’, the ‘zh’ sound
is in the middle.

511
00:44:06,865 --> 00:44:14,147
The mouth position is always the same: teeth
together, lips flare.

512
00:44:14,376 --> 00:44:20,203
The SH and ZH consonants.

513
00:44:20,203 --> 00:44:25,949
Shop, wish, Asia.

514
00:44:27,352 --> 00:44:29,210
Example words.

515
00:44:29,210 --> 00:44:30,515
Repeat with me:

516
00:44:30,515 --> 00:44:37,876
should

517
00:44:37,876 --> 00:44:45,000
special

518
00:44:46,403 --> 00:44:53,958
wash

519
00:44:53,958 --> 00:45:01,439
measure

520
00:45:02,794 --> 00:45:09,501
garage

521
00:45:11,533 --> 00:45:18,209
Usual

522
00:45:18,209 --> 00:45:20,960
The H consonant sound.

523
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:29,579
This sound is simply made, hh, by passing
air through a very slightly constricted passage,

524
00:45:29,579 --> 00:45:38,340
either between the tongue and the roof of
the mouth, hh, or in the throat, hh.

525
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:41,619
This is an unvoiced consonant.

526
00:45:42,393 --> 00:45:47,167
Part the lips and press the tongue down in
the back just a little.

527
00:45:47,167 --> 00:45:55,900
If you don’t constrict the air passage at
all, there’s no sound.

528
00:45:55,900 --> 00:46:04,160
If you lift the back of your tongue and constrict
too much, hhh, you’ll feel the vibration

529
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:07,900
of the soft palate bouncing on the tongue.

530
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:10,549
This is too heavy.

531
00:46:10,549 --> 00:46:12,549
Hh.

532
00:46:12,549 --> 00:46:18,609
The lips and jaw don’t affect this sound,
so your mouth can be in position for the next

533
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:21,329
sound when you’re making the H.

534
00:46:21,329 --> 00:46:27,311
For example, the word how, how.

535
00:46:27,311 --> 00:46:35,529
The lips, jaw, and tongue take the beginning
position of the 'ow' as in 'now' diphthong,

536
00:46:35,529 --> 00:46:38,982
hh-, how.

537
00:46:38,982 --> 00:46:42,835
Let’s look up close and in slow motion.

538
00:46:42,835 --> 00:46:48,430
The sound by itself: the jaw is relaxed and
the lips part.

539
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:54,430
The word ‘hi’: there’s nothing to see
at the beginning of this word.

540
00:46:54,430 --> 00:47:01,670
The H sound happens without changing what
the lips do for the AI as in BUY diphthong.

541
00:47:01,670 --> 00:47:08,099
The word who’: Again, there’s nothing
to see at the beginning of this word.

542
00:47:08,099 --> 00:47:14,569
The H sound happens without changing what
the lips do for the next sound, the OO as

543
00:47:14,569 --> 00:47:16,384
in BOO vowel.

544
00:47:17,084 --> 00:47:23,390
This sound is most common at the beginning
of a word, and never occurs at the end of

545
00:47:23,390 --> 00:47:28,857
a word in American English, but the letter
H does.

546
00:47:28,857 --> 00:47:35,414
The H sound: hi, who.

547
00:47:35,414 --> 00:47:37,410
Example words.

548
00:47:37,410 --> 00:47:39,501
Repeat with me:

549
00:47:39,501 --> 00:47:47,176
Hope

550
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:56,329
History

551
00:47:57,490 --> 00:48:04,223
Ahead

552
00:48:04,851 --> 00:48:11,892
Behind

553
00:48:11,892 --> 00:48:18,895
Here

554
00:48:19,137 --> 00:48:26,380
Somehow

555
00:48:26,380 --> 00:48:29,900
The L consonant sound.

556
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:33,059
This sound is especially difficult.

557
00:48:33,059 --> 00:48:38,500
There are actually two kinds of L’s, and
they’re not made the same way.

558
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:44,910
But, if you look up a word in the dictionary,
there is only one International Phonetic Alphabet

559
00:48:44,910 --> 00:48:52,569
Symbol for both kinds of L. In this video,
you’ll learn when to make which kind of

560
00:48:52,569 --> 00:48:54,049
L.

561
00:48:54,049 --> 00:48:58,059
First, the Light L sound.

562
00:48:58,059 --> 00:49:04,931
This is what most people think of when they
think of an L. The L is a ‘Light L’ when

563
00:49:04,931 --> 00:49:09,839
it comes before the vowel or diphthong in
a syllable.

564
00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:18,569
For example, let’s, flake, release.

565
00:49:18,569 --> 00:49:23,765
There are two different ways native speakers
make this sound.

566
00:49:23,765 --> 00:49:30,670
One way is to lift the tongue so the tip is
touching the roof of the mouth, just behind

567
00:49:30,670 --> 00:49:32,319
the front teeth.

568
00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:39,699
This is not the same as the T, D, and N tongue
positions, where the tongue lifts so the top

569
00:49:39,699 --> 00:49:42,349
is touching the roof of the mouth.

570
00:49:42,349 --> 00:49:45,150
This is the tip.

571
00:49:45,150 --> 00:49:50,890
Another way native speakers make this sound
looks like the TH, with the tongue tip touching

572
00:49:50,890 --> 00:49:54,269
the bottom of the top front teeth.

573
00:49:54,269 --> 00:50:01,229
The contact with the teeth is more firm than
the TH sound, pushing up on the top teeth.

574
00:50:01,229 --> 00:50:07,366
The tongue is not as loose or relaxed in the
L as it is in the TH.

575
00:50:09,011 --> 00:50:15,000
Let’s look at the Light L up close and in
slow motion.

576
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:21,289
Here is one way to make the L, with the tongue
tip coming through the teeth to press up on

577
00:50:21,289 --> 00:50:24,309
the bottom of the top front teeth.

578
00:50:24,309 --> 00:50:30,599
Here is the second way to make the Light L:
the tip at the roof of the mouth just behind

579
00:50:30,599 --> 00:50:32,140
the teeth.

580
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,809
Here’s the word ‘lack’.

581
00:50:35,809 --> 00:50:39,687
The tongue comes through the teeth to make
the Light L.

582
00:50:41,622 --> 00:50:44,269
The word ‘slow’.

583
00:50:44,269 --> 00:50:48,705
The Light L is made with the tongue tip at
the roof of the mouth.

584
00:50:51,365 --> 00:50:58,920
The second kind of L is the Dark L. This is
the sound that happens when the L comes after

585
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:06,477
the vowel or diphthong in a word or syllable,
like ‘real’ or ‘Google’.

586
00:51:06,477 --> 00:51:14,489
This sound has two parts, but many Americans
leave out the second part in most cases.

587
00:51:14,489 --> 00:51:18,359
You should too, it makes it easier to pronounce.

588
00:51:18,359 --> 00:51:24,670
The first and most important part of the Dark
L is the ‘dark’ sound.

589
00:51:24,670 --> 00:51:31,069
This defines the dark L. To make this sound,
you don’t lift your tongue tip.

590
00:51:31,069 --> 00:51:37,109
Instead, it’s down, touching the back of
the bottom front teeth.

591
00:51:37,109 --> 00:51:40,753
The back part of the tongue pulls back towards
the throat.

592
00:51:40,753 --> 00:51:47,309
You can see there isn’t much jaw drop, and
the lips are relaxed.

593
00:51:47,309 --> 00:51:49,099
Uuhl.

594
00:51:49,099 --> 00:51:55,750
You should feel the vibration in the throat
and not the face, uuhl.

595
00:51:55,750 --> 00:52:00,160
The back part of the tongue presses down or
shifts back.

596
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:03,770
This is an important part of the sound.

597
00:52:03,770 --> 00:52:06,812
Uuhl, uuhl.

598
00:52:06,812 --> 00:52:18,676
Most Americans will stop there when making
the Dark L -- ‘real’, ‘Google’, ‘thoughtful’

599
00:52:18,676 --> 00:52:24,579
-- unless they’re linking into a word that
that begins with an L or a sound with a similar

600
00:52:24,579 --> 00:52:32,900
position like N, T, or D. In that case, go
ahead to make the second part of the dark L. 

601
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:39,430
The second part of the Dark L is the Light
L: bring your tongue tip up to the roof of

602
00:52:39,430 --> 00:52:42,520
the mouth or through the teeth.

603
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:48,809
Some native speakers make the full Dark L,
both parts, all the time.

604
00:52:48,809 --> 00:52:52,469
What’s important is the ‘dark’ sound.

605
00:52:52,469 --> 00:52:54,749
Make it with the back of the tongue.

606
00:52:54,749 --> 00:53:01,918
And make sure you never leave that part out,
uuhl, uuhl.

607
00:53:01,918 --> 00:53:05,380
Again, the Dark L has two parts.

608
00:53:05,380 --> 00:53:11,789
The first and most important part: the tongue
pulls back or presses down in the back.

609
00:53:12,515 --> 00:53:19,660
The second part, which is often left out:
either option for the Light L. Here, the option

610
00:53:19,660 --> 00:53:23,759
with the tongue tip at the roof of the mouth
is pictured.

611
00:53:23,759 --> 00:53:30,349
Let’s look at the Dark L up close and in
slow motion.

612
00:53:30,349 --> 00:53:32,109
The word ‘feel’. 

613
00:53:32,109 --> 00:53:36,950
The tongue tip arches in the front for the
EE vowel.

614
00:53:36,950 --> 00:53:40,170
Watch as the tongue lowers in the back.

615
00:53:40,170 --> 00:53:44,569
Now the tongue is lowed, pulling back a little
bit in the back.

616
00:53:44,569 --> 00:53:50,380
It’s hard to see because of the lips, but
the tip of the tongue is still forward.

617
00:53:50,380 --> 00:53:53,729
Notice that lips are relaxed.

618
00:53:53,729 --> 00:53:55,499
The word ‘recall’.

619
00:53:55,499 --> 00:54:00,819
The dark part is made with the back of the
tongue as the jaw closes.

620
00:54:00,819 --> 00:54:07,589
This time, the dark L does end with the second
part, the Light L. The tongue tip quickly

621
00:54:07,589 --> 00:54:10,010
comes through the teeth.

622
00:54:10,010 --> 00:54:12,670
Lips are relaxed.

623
00:54:12,670 --> 00:54:19,039
The relaxation of the lips is important in
the Dark L. Many non-native speakers want

624
00:54:19,039 --> 00:54:25,710
to round or flare the lips, which brings the
sound forward and changes it.

625
00:54:25,710 --> 00:54:28,709
But the dark sound is made back here.

626
00:54:28,709 --> 00:54:35,739
Leave the lips relaxed so the sound can be
made in the back of the mouth.

627
00:54:35,739 --> 00:54:41,349
When you look at the International Phonetic
Alphabet transcription for a word in a dictionary,

628
00:54:41,349 --> 00:54:47,890
you’ll just see one symbol, whether it’s
a Light L or a Dark L. It’s up to you to

629
00:54:47,890 --> 00:54:52,880
know when to make a Dark L: when the L sound
comes at the end of a syllable.

630
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:58,079
Remember, we’re talking about sounds and
not letters.

631
00:54:58,079 --> 00:55:05,769
In the example ‘Google’, you see the letter
E after the L. E is a vowel.

632
00:55:05,769 --> 00:55:12,969
But when you look at the phonetic transcription
of the word, the last SOUND is the L. So the

633
00:55:12,969 --> 00:55:21,049
L in ‘Google’ is a Dark L. Uuhl, uuhl,
Google.

634
00:55:21,049 --> 00:55:28,910
If you integrate a good Dark L sound into
your speech, it will help you sound more American.

635
00:55:28,910 --> 00:55:35,229
The Light L: lack, slow

636
00:55:35,229 --> 00:55:41,802
The Dark L: feel, recall

637
00:55:41,802 --> 00:55:43,750
Example Words.

638
00:55:43,750 --> 00:55:45,548
Repeat with me:

639
00:55:45,548 --> 00:55:51,349
Love

640
00:55:53,235 --> 00:56:00,523
Hello

641
00:56:01,684 --> 00:56:08,342
Flat

642
00:56:09,116 --> 00:56:16,081
Feel

643
00:56:17,774 --> 00:56:24,376
Table

644
00:56:25,537 --> 00:56:32,390
People

645
00:56:32,390 --> 00:56:35,970
The M consonant sound.

646
00:56:35,970 --> 00:56:43,049
This sound is simply made by pressing the
lips together lightly, mm, while making a

647
00:56:43,049 --> 00:56:45,349
sound with the vocal cords.

648
00:56:45,349 --> 00:56:50,459
So, this is a voiced consonant, mm.

649
00:56:50,459 --> 00:56:59,640
The teeth may begin to part a little in preparation
for the next sound, mm, which will pull the

650
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:05,959
lips a little bit, mm.

651
00:57:05,959 --> 00:57:13,009
Because the soft palate is lowered, air comes
up through the nasal passages.

652
00:57:13,009 --> 00:57:15,920
This makes it a ‘nasal consonant’.

653
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:22,459
You can feel the vibration in your nose, mm.

654
00:57:22,459 --> 00:57:32,519
There are only three nasal sounds in American
English: nn, ng, mm.

655
00:57:32,519 --> 00:57:38,239
Let’s look at this sound up close and in
slow motion.

656
00:57:38,239 --> 00:57:40,789
The word ‘mom’.

657
00:57:40,789 --> 00:57:45,319
Lips press together as the jaw drops a little
bit. 

658
00:57:45,319 --> 00:57:50,069
Another M at the end, lips press together.

659
00:57:50,069 --> 00:57:51,789
Summer.

660
00:57:51,789 --> 00:57:55,519
Lips press together.

661
00:57:55,519 --> 00:57:58,239
The M consonant.

662
00:57:58,239 --> 00:58:02,317
Mom, summer.

663
00:58:02,317 --> 00:58:03,801

00:58:03,801 --> 00:58:05,630

The N consonant sound.

672
00:58:57,309 --> 00:59:05,280
To make this sound, the jaw drops a little,
and the lips part, nn.  

673
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:09,249
The front, flat part of the tongue goes to
the roof of the mouth.

674
00:59:09,249 --> 00:59:12,729
Make sure to keep your tongue wide as you
do that.

675
00:59:12,729 --> 00:59:15,529
The soft palate is lowered.

676
00:59:15,529 --> 00:59:19,920
Air comes up through the nasal passages.

677
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:22,630
This makes it a ‘nasal consonant’.

678
00:59:22,630 --> 00:59:26,220
You can feel the vibration in your nose.

679
00:59:26,220 --> 00:59:28,049
Nn.

680
00:59:28,049 --> 00:59:37,140
There are only three nasal sounds in American
English: nn, ng, mm.

681
00:59:37,962 --> 00:59:42,779
It’s very important that the tongue be relaxed.

682
00:59:42,779 --> 00:59:49,049
If there’s tension in the back of the tongue,
it will sound somewhat like the NG sound,

683
00:59:49,049 --> 00:59:54,979
ng, even if the front of the tongue is in
the right position.

684
00:59:54,979 --> 01:00:01,249
One thing that will help relaxation is to
think about keeping the tongue really wide,

685
01:00:01,249 --> 01:00:04,650
nn, nn.

686
01:00:05,617 --> 01:00:11,239
Let’s look up close and in slow  motion.

687
01:00:11,239 --> 01:00:12,890
The N sound.

688
01:00:12,890 --> 01:00:18,140
Lips relaxed, tongue wide and lifted to the
roof of the mouth.

689
01:00:18,140 --> 01:00:24,099
If you see any darkness on the sides of the
tongue when you practice, that means there

690
01:00:24,099 --> 01:00:26,869
is tension in the tongue.

691
01:00:26,869 --> 01:00:31,029
Try to release that tension and keep the tongue
wide.

692
01:00:31,029 --> 01:00:33,459
The word ‘no’.

693
01:00:33,459 --> 01:00:38,630
Tongue soft, relaxed, and wide.

694
01:00:38,630 --> 01:00:41,759
The word ‘snag’.

695
01:00:41,759 --> 01:00:46,520
Front of the tongue to roof of mouth.

696
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:55,730
The word ‘on’: wide tongue to the roof
of the mouth to finish the word.

697
01:00:55,730 --> 01:01:04,318
The N consonant sound: no, snag, on.

698
01:01:04,318 --> 01:01:06,529
Example words.

699
01:01:06,529 --> 01:01:08,000
Repeat with me:

700
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:15,000
Nice

701
01:01:15,242 --> 01:01:22,017
One

702
01:01:23,710 --> 01:01:31,095
Number

703
01:01:32,498 --> 01:01:39,851
Woman

704
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:47,983
Win  

705
01:01:49,047 --> 01:01:55,609
Any

706
01:01:57,544 --> 01:02:05,289
End

707
01:02:05,289 --> 01:02:08,890
The NG consonant sound. 

708
01:02:08,890 --> 01:02:15,109
To make this sound, the jaw drops a little
bit, ng.

709
01:02:15,109 --> 01:02:21,460
The lips part, and the back part of the tongue
stretches all the way up to the soft palate.

710
01:02:21,460 --> 01:02:24,150
The tongue tip is forward.

711
01:02:24,150 --> 01:02:30,380
Because the soft palate is lowered, air comes
up through the nasal passages.

712
01:02:30,380 --> 01:02:33,390
This makes it a ‘nasal consonant’.

713
01:02:33,390 --> 01:02:37,349
You can feel the vibration in your nose.

714
01:02:37,349 --> 01:02:39,009
Ng.

715
01:02:39,009 --> 01:02:48,119
There are only three nasal sounds in American
English: nn, ng, mm.

716
01:02:48,119 --> 01:02:52,809
Let’s study it up close and in slow motion.

717
01:02:52,809 --> 01:02:56,689
A relaxed, lowered jaw.

718
01:02:56,689 --> 01:03:01,460
Since this sound is made at the back of the
mouth, it’s hard to get a clear picture

719
01:03:01,460 --> 01:03:02,829
of it.

720
01:03:02,829 --> 01:03:08,589
The tongue lifts in the back, while the tip
stays down and forward.

721
01:03:08,589 --> 01:03:11,009
The word ‘ring’.

722
01:03:11,009 --> 01:03:16,119
The tongue lifts in the back, while the tip
stays down and forward.

723
01:03:16,119 --> 01:03:18,670
Lips are relaxed.

724
01:03:18,670 --> 01:03:20,759
The word ‘along’.

725
01:03:20,759 --> 01:03:26,099
Since the tongue is low for the vowel before,
it’s easier to see the tongue lift in the

726
01:03:26,099 --> 01:03:27,460
back.

727
01:03:27,460 --> 01:03:32,439
And now it’s lifted in the back, with relaxed
lips.

728
01:03:32,439 --> 01:03:34,289
The word ‘finger’.

729
01:03:34,289 --> 01:03:42,679
Again, the tongue lifts in the back, while
the tip stays down and forward.

730
01:03:42,679 --> 01:03:48,759
This sound can occur in the middle or at the
end of a word in American English, but not

731
01:03:48,759 --> 01:03:51,239
at the beginning.

732
01:03:51,239 --> 01:04:00,000
The NG consonant: ring, along, finger.

733
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,999
Example words.

734
01:04:01,999 --> 01:04:03,764
Repeat with me.

735
01:04:03,764 --> 01:04:10,601
Anger

736
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:19,727
Song

737
01:04:21,130 --> 01:04:29,609
Wing

738
01:04:31,253 --> 01:04:38,521
English

739
01:04:38,860 --> 01:04:46,480
Single

740
01:04:47,350 --> 01:04:54,958
Beginning

741
01:04:55,829 --> 01:04:57,779
The W sound.

742
01:04:57,779 --> 01:05:05,209
To make this sound, ww, ww, the lips form
a tight circle, ww.

743
01:05:05,209 --> 01:05:10,500
The back part of the tongue stretches up,
towards the soft palate, while the front of

744
01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:15,960
the tongue lightly touches the back of the
bottom front teeth.

745
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:21,309
To give this sound the right quality, you
have to close the vocal cords to get this

746
01:05:21,309 --> 01:05:29,440
sound: ww, which we add to the sound, ww.

747
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:36,819
You release the vocal cords as you release
the lips, coming out of the W sound, ww.

748
01:05:36,819 --> 01:05:41,329
Let’s look at the sound up close and in
slow motion.

749
01:05:41,329 --> 01:05:46,130
With the tight circle for the lips, you can’t
see the tongue at all.

750
01:05:46,130 --> 01:05:48,069
But it lifts in the back.

751
01:05:48,069 --> 01:05:49,939
The word ‘why’.

752
01:05:49,939 --> 01:05:55,359
A tight circle for the lips.

753
01:05:55,359 --> 01:05:57,140
The word ‘west’.

754
01:05:57,140 --> 01:06:01,969
Again, a tight circle for the lips.

755
01:06:01,969 --> 01:06:04,119
The word ‘unwind’.

756
01:06:04,119 --> 01:06:07,049
Here the W is in the middle of the word.

757
01:06:07,049 --> 01:06:14,259
We still take the time to bring the lips into
a tight circle.

758
01:06:14,259 --> 01:06:17,950
This sound is most common at the beginning
of words.

759
01:06:17,950 --> 01:06:25,009
It doesn’t occur at the end of any words,
though the letter W does.

760
01:06:25,009 --> 01:06:32,655
The W consonant: why, west, unwind

761
01:06:32,655 --> 01:06:34,898
Example words.

762
01:06:34,898 --> 01:06:36,607
Repeat with me.

763
01:06:36,607 --> 01:06:43,061
Water

764
01:06:43,980 --> 01:06:50,346
Welcome

765
01:06:52,039 --> 01:06:56,715
Rework

766
01:06:58,408 --> 01:07:03,901
Away

767
01:07:05,884 --> 01:07:11,253
Between

768
01:07:12,414 --> 01:07:18,400
Will

769
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:20,599
The Y consonant.

770
01:07:20,599 --> 01:07:27,369
To make the Y sound, the jaw drops a little
bit, yy.

771
01:07:27,369 --> 01:07:34,509
The lips may be relaxed, or they may begin
to take the position of the next sound.

772
01:07:34,509 --> 01:07:39,490
The tongue tip is down, lightly touching the
back of the bottom front teeth.

773
01:07:39,490 --> 01:07:43,499
The middle part of the tongue lifts and touches
the roof of the mouth.

774
01:07:43,499 --> 01:07:49,630
It pushes forward against the roof of the
mouth before pulling away.

775
01:07:49,630 --> 01:07:54,479
As we push the tongue forward on the roof
of the mouth, we close the vocal cords to

776
01:07:54,479 --> 01:08:02,039
get this sound: yy, which we add to the sound.

777
01:08:02,039 --> 01:08:04,859
Yy, yy.

778
01:08:04,859 --> 01:08:09,279
We release them the same time we release the
tongue.

779
01:08:09,279 --> 01:08:12,819
Relaxed jaw drop, and the lips are relaxed.

780
01:08:12,819 --> 01:08:17,790
The tongue tip is down while the middle of
the tongue presses forward against the roof

781
01:08:17,790 --> 01:08:20,310
of the mouth.

782
01:08:20,310 --> 01:08:22,069
The word ‘yes’.

783
01:08:22,069 --> 01:08:26,870
The tongue tip is down while the middle of
the tongue presses forward against the roof

784
01:08:26,870 --> 01:08:28,109
of the mouth.

785
01:08:28,109 --> 01:08:32,690
The tongue releases into the EH as in BED
vowel.

786
01:08:32,690 --> 01:08:35,170
The word ‘youth’.

787
01:08:35,170 --> 01:08:42,790
Notice how the lips begin to round for the
next sound, the OO as in BOO vowel.

788
01:08:42,790 --> 01:08:45,370
‘Yell’.

789
01:08:45,370 --> 01:08:50,620
The tongue tip is down while the middle of
the tongue presses forward against the roof

790
01:08:50,620 --> 01:08:57,330
of the mouth, releasing into the EH as in
BED vowel.

791
01:08:57,330 --> 01:09:00,960
This sound is most common at the beginning
of words.

792
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:07,850
It doesn’t occur at the end of any words,
though the letter Y does.

793
01:09:07,850 --> 01:09:16,331
The Y sound: yes, youth, yell.

794
01:09:16,331 --> 01:09:18,215
Example words.

795
01:09:18,215 --> 01:09:20,076
Repeat with me.

796
01:09:20,076 --> 01:09:25,802
Yeah

797
01:09:26,915 --> 01:09:33,253
Unusual

798
01:09:35,333 --> 01:09:41,358
Senior

799
01:09:41,987 --> 01:09:47,388
You 

800
01:09:48,501 --> 01:09:53,805
Yesterday

801
01:09:54,772 --> 01:10:00,256
Yellow

802
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:06,730
I’m so glad you’ve taken the time to watch
video, really understanding the mouth positions

803
01:10:06,730 --> 01:10:12,980
for the sounds of American English can help
you gain greater clarity in spoken English.

804
01:10:12,980 --> 01:10:17,190
We also have a compilation video on all the
vowel and diphthong sounds.

805
01:10:17,190 --> 01:10:20,270
I’ll put a link to that video in the video
description.

806
01:10:20,270 --> 01:10:25,350
For now, keep your learning with this video
and don’t forget to subscribe with notifications

807
01:10:25,350 --> 01:10:26,350
on.

808
01:10:26,350 --> 01:10:27,950
I love being your English teacher.

809
01:10:27,950 --> 01:10:32,119
That’s it and thanks so much for using Rachel’s
English.
