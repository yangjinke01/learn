1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,780
In this American English pronunciation

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:04,790
video, we’re going to learn how to

3
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:08,480
pronounce the OO as in BOO vowel.

4
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:18,260
This sound is a little different from all

5
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:21,439
of the other vowel sounds. Other vowel

6
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,740
sounds have one mouth position, ee, for

7
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:28,990
example. And it’s the position of the

8
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:31,390
tongue, lips, and jaw that make the

9
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:34,480
sound. For this vowel, the movement

10
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,550
into and out of the position is just as

11
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:42,320
important as the position itself, ih-oo.

12
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,040
We’ll talk about that in a second. First,

13
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:48,670
let’s take a look at the mouth position.

14
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:50,559
To make this sound, the back part of

15
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:52,600
the tongue stretches up towards the

16
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,120
soft palate. The front part of the

17
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,949
tongue remains down, lightly touching,

18
00:00:57,949 --> 00:01:02,399
or just behind, the bottom front teeth.

19
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,589
I'm sure you can see the lips round a

20
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:07,939
lot. We want to begin this sound with

21
00:01:07,939 --> 00:01:10,900
lips that are more relaxed to move into

22
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:12,710
this tighter lip position.

23
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:17,540
Let’s take the word ‘do’ as an example.

24
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:19,670
The lip position doesn’t matter for the

25
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:22,930
D sound. The lips can start moving into

26
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:25,490
the position for the next sound when

27
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:27,860
making the D, like in the consonant

28
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:32,079
cluster ‘drop’. Did you see how my lips

29
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:34,290
were already forming the R when I

30
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:39,850
made the D? Drop. So what happens

31
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:42,920
when we make the lip position for OO

32
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:49,640
as we make the D sound? Du, du.

33
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:56,020
That’s not the right sound, do, du. To

34
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:58,610
make the right American OO sound, the

35
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:02,310
lips have to start out, more relaxed, and

36
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:05,210
then come into this tight circle. This

37
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:07,799
transition into position for the sound is

38
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:10,759
just as important as the position itself.

39
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:14,680
Let’s see up close and in slow motion.

40
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,920
Lips start in a bigger flare, more

41
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,300
relaxed, before moving into the tighter

42
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:22,250
circle. Look at how much the corners of

43
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:25,129
the lips come in for this sound.

44
00:02:25,129 --> 00:02:28,440
Now let’s take a look at the word ‘do’.

45
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,989
Remember, we don’t want to start with

46
00:02:30,989 --> 00:02:33,780
the lips in a tight circle, but in a more

47
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:36,400
relaxed position so they can move into

48
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,970
the tight circle. Then lips move from

49
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:41,569
the flare into the tighter circle.

50
00:02:41,569 --> 00:02:43,239
It might help to think to think of this

51
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:47,030
sound as ih-oo, starting with a more

52
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:51,660
relaxed lip position. Ih-oo.

53
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:54,519
In a stressed syllable, you have an up-

54
00:02:54,519 --> 00:03:00,879
down shape in the voice, OO, OO. In an

55
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,989
unstressed syllable, the pitch will be

56
00:03:02,989 --> 00:03:06,319
flatter and lower, and it will be quieter

57
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:11,560
and quicker, oo, oo. The OO vowel is

58
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:16,900
unstressed in the word ‘visual’, oo.

59
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:19,600
Let’s take a look up close and in slow

60
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:20,290
motion.

61
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:22,909
Often, unstressed vowels have a more

62
00:03:22,909 --> 00:03:26,480
relaxed lip position. Notice that, for the

63
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,250
oo vowel, the lips do still come into a

64
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:32,000
tight circle.

65
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,340
The OO vowel stressed: do, OO

66
00:03:38,349 --> 00:03:44,669
The OO vowel unstressed: visual, oo

67
00:03:44,669 --> 00:03:51,920
OO, oo, OO, oo.

68
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,140
Example words. Repeat with me:

69
00:03:55,140 --> 00:04:35,160
Blue, issue, suit, move, influence, two.
