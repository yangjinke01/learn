1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,520
Most advanced—even fluent—English students
have had a shocking experience when they try

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,120
to have a conversation in English: they don’t
speak with confidence.

3
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:12,759
The sounds of American English are hard.

4
00:00:12,759 --> 00:00:18,180
And many people have never learned the correct
pronunciation of each specific sound.

5
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:21,949
Welcome to your Sounds of American English
course.

6
00:00:21,949 --> 00:00:26,289
In this course you’ll learn exactly how
to make each sound in American English by

7
00:00:26,289 --> 00:00:31,380
studying how to move your tongue, lips, and
jaw through illustrations and close-ups of

8
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:32,380
the mouth.

9
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:36,489
You’ll even learn the phonetic symbols for
each sound, which is so important with English

10
00:00:36,489 --> 00:00:39,260
since it’s not a phonetic language.

11
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:43,129
Letters don’t always match with the sounds
you would expect to hear.

12
00:00:43,129 --> 00:00:44,129
What?

13
00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:45,129
This is ‘colonel’?

14
00:00:45,129 --> 00:00:46,500
Where’s the R?!?

15
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,809
How comfortable are you making the TH?

16
00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:50,520
What about the American R?

17
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:55,620
Don’t let your spoken English skills get
in the way of confidently meeting and speaking

18
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,000
with others in English.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,309
“The limits of my language mean the limits
of my world.”

20
00:01:01,309 --> 00:01:02,629
What are your limits?

21
00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:08,180
Leave them behind as you build a solid foundation
for spoken English by perfecting the building

22
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:11,820
blocks – the Sounds of American English.

23
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,480
You can do this.
