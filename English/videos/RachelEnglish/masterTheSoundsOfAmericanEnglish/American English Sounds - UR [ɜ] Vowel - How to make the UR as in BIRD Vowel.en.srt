00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:03,470
In this American English pronunciation video,

2
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:05,879
we’re going to learn how to make the

3
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:09,359
UR as in BIRD sound.

4
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,990
I sometimes say this is the vowel version

5
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:24,420
of the R consonant. It's always followed by R,

6
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,550
and there's no distinction between the

7
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:29,750
sounds in American English. This sound

8
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:32,399
will always be written with two different

9
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,200
International Phonetic Alphabet, or IPA,

10
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,680
symbols, but will be pronounced

11
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:43,370
rrrrrr, just one sound, bird.

12
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:46,539
To make this sound, the corners of the

13
00:00:46,539 --> 00:00:48,950
lips come in, pushing the lips away

14
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:51,329
from the face. The middle part of the

15
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:53,489
tongue lifts towards the roof of the mouth

16
00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:56,230
in the middle. The front of the tongue hangs

17
00:00:56,230 --> 00:01:00,039
down, but it's drawn back a bit. So, it's not

18
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:02,219
touching anything.

19
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:05,500
As the tongue lifts in the middle, it may be

20
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,860
close to the roof of the mouth without

21
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:11,350
touching it, or it may touch the sides of

22
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:14,460
the roof of the mouth, or the insides or

23
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:20,979
bottom of the top teeth, here, ur, ur.

24
00:01:20,979 --> 00:01:24,960
This, along with the R consonant, is one

25
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,479
of the hardest sounds to make in American

26
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:30,720
English. It’s especially hard because the

27
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,600
lip position hides the tongue position.

28
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,930
Let’s take a look.

29
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:38,090
From the side, we can’t even see the

30
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:40,710
tongue. The front view doesn’t help

31
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:43,520
much either. This is because the

32
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,909
tongue goes back, but the lips flare

33
00:01:45,909 --> 00:01:47,620
forward.

34
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:50,740
Here’s the word ‘hurt’. Watch the

35
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:52,790
tongue pull back and up

36
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,820
before coming forward for the T.

37
00:02:02,829 --> 00:02:06,060
In a stressed syllable, the UR vowel curves

38
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:12,770
up then down. Hurt, ur. In an unstressed

39
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:15,849
syllable, it’s lower in pitch, as well as

40
00:02:15,849 --> 00:02:21,030
quieter and quicker, ur, ur. The vowel

41
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:26,460
is unstressed in the word ‘research’, ur.

42
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:28,800
Let’s look at this word up close

43
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,160
and in slow motion.

44
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,459
The lips flare, but the jaw doesn’t

45
00:02:33,459 --> 00:02:35,339
drop as much.

46
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:38,140
Let’s compare the stressed UR in

47
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:41,360
‘hurt’, on the top, with the unstressed

48
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,890
vowel in ‘research’, on the bottom.

49
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:48,099
The lips flare for both, but in this case,

50
00:02:48,099 --> 00:02:50,160
there was much more jaw drop for the

51
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,099
stressed version of this vowel.

52
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:56,080
This is typical. Unstressed vowels are

53
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,890
shorter, so there isn’t as much time to

54
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:02,120
make the full mouth position.

55
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:09,900
The UR vowel, stressed: hurt, UR

56
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:16,680
Unstressed: research, ur

57
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:24,340
UR, ur, UR, ur

58
00:03:24,349 --> 00:03:28,589
Example words. Repeat with me:

59
00:03:28,589 --> 00:04:18,660
Earth, search, circle, thirteen, return, outburst.

60
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:21,269
I hope this video helps you understand

61
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:24,750
this sound. That’s it, and thanks so much

62
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,990
for using Rachel’s English.
