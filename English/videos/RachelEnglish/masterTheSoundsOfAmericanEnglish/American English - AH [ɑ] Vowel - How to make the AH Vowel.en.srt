00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,139
In this American English pronunciation

2
00:00:03,139 --> 00:00:05,430
video, we’re going to learn how to

3
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:09,469
pronounce the AH as in FATHER vowel.

4
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:22,460
This vowel needs a lot of jaw drop. Ah.

5
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:24,820
The tongue tip lightly touches behind

6
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:27,119
the bottom front teeth, and the back

7
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:32,139
part of the tongue presses down a little bit.

8
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:37,760
Ah. The lips are neutral, very relaxed.

9
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,060
Ah. Because the tongue presses down

10
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:43,640
in the back, you can see further into the

11
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,190
dark space in the mouth. Let’s see

12
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:48,840
that by watching this vowel up close

13
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,309
and in slow motion.

14
00:00:51,309 --> 00:00:53,219
The lips are relaxed, and the tongue is

15
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:56,190
lowered in the back. The inside of the

16
00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:00,129
mouth is dark.

17
00:01:00,129 --> 00:01:04,530
The word ‘job’. The jaw drops, and the

18
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:09,000
tongue presses down in the back.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,780
Ah. When this vowel is in a stressed

20
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,890
syllable, the voice will go up and come

21
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:23,960
down in pitch, ah, job, ah. When it’s in

22
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,570
an unstressed syllable, it won’t be as

23
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:29,130
long, and it won’t have the up-down

24
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:34,950
shape of the voice, ah, ah. For example,

25
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:43,640
in the word ‘blockade’, ah, ah, blockade.

26
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:46,460
The mouth position looks the same: jaw

27
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:49,840
drop, relaxed lips, and tongue pressed

28
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:55,790
slightly down in the back. But because

29
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:58,130
the pitch is flatter and the syllable is

30
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:04,829
quicker, it sounds unstressed. Ah, ah.

31
00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:11,400
Stressed AH: job, AH.

32
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:17,680
Unstressed ah: blockade, ah.

33
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:24,150
AH, ah. AH, ah.

34
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:27,650
Example words. Repeat with me:
