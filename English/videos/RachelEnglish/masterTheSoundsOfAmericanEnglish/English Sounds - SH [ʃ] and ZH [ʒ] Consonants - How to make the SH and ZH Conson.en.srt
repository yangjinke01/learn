00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:06,760
In this American English pronunciation video, we’re going to learn how to pronounce the

2
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:11,240
SH and DJ consonant sounds.

3
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:23,280
These two sounds are paired together because they take the same mouth position.

4
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:29,180
SH is unvoiced, meaning only air passes through the mouth.

5
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:36,500
And DJ is voiced, meaning you make sound with your vocal cords.

6
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:44,980
DJ. To make these sounds, the teeth come together, the corners of the lips come in, and the lips flare.

7
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:51,400
The tongue lifts so the front, middle part of the tongue is very close to the roof of the mouth,

8
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,280
but not touching it.

9
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,400
The tongue tip points forward but doesn’t touch anything.

10
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:02,920
Let's look at these sounds up close and in slow motion.

11
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:08,820
The lips flare and the teeth come together.

12
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:17,000
In the word 'shop', the SH is at the beginning of the word.

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,220
In the word ‘wish’, it’s at the end.

14
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:31,080
In the word ‘Asia’, the ZH sound is in the middle.

15
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:34,180
The mouth position is always the same.

16
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:38,740
Teeth together, lips flare.

17
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:43,960
The SH and ZH consonants.

18
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,120
Shop

19
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,320
Wish

20
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,140
Asia

21
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:54,600
Example words. Repeat with me.

22
00:01:54,600 --> 00:02:02,140
Should. SH. Should.

23
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:10,260
Special. SH. Special.

24
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:18,580
Wash. SH. Wash.

25
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:26,720
Measure. ZH. Measure.

26
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:35,620
Garage. ZH. Garage.

27
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:42,200

This video is one of 36 in a new series, The Sounds of American English.

29
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:54,020
Videos in this set will be released here on YouTube twice a month,

30
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:59,400
first and third Thursdays, in 2016 and 2017.

31
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,760
But the whole set can be all yours right now.

32
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:09,500
The real value of these videos is watching them as a set, as a whole

33
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:14,480
to give your mind the time to take it all in and get the bigger picture.

34
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:21,040
Most of the materials you'll find elsewhere just teach the sounds on their own in isolation.

35
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:29,940
It's a mistake to learn them this way. We learn the sounds to speak words and sentences, not just sounds.
