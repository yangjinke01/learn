00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,880
In this American English Pronunciation video,

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:09,500
we're going to study how to make the T and D consonant sounds.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,800
These two sounds are paired together because they take the same mouth position.

4
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,320
Tt-- is unvoiced.

5
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,380
Meaning only air passes through the mouth.

6
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:31,280
And dd-- is voiced.

7
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:37,160
Meaning, dd-- you make a sound with the vocal chords.

8
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:42,360
These consonants are complicated because the way Americans pronounce them

9
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:46,200
isn't always what you'll find in a dictionary.

10
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:50,240
First, let's talk about the true pronunciation.

11
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:55,220
These are stop consonants which means there are two parts.

12
00:00:55,220 --> 00:01:00,120
First, a stop in the airflow, and second, a release.

13
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:03,940
We stop here, by closing the vocal chords.,

14
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:09,500
and lift the tongue so the flat, top part is at the roof of the mouth

15
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:14,800
It's far forward, almost touching the back of the top front teeth.

16
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:19,820
The teeth come together and we release all three parts at once.

17
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:22,600
The tongue comes down from the roof of the mouth,

18
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,800
the teeth part,

19
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:28,120
and we release the air in the throat

20
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:30,480
Tt---

21
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,260
Dd---

22
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:35,340
Just like with other stop consonants,

23
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:38,760
we want to release them into the next sound.

24
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:42,400
Let's look at the true T and D consonants

25
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,280
up close and in slow motion.

26
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:50,560
The teeth come together and the top , front part of the tongue is at the roof of the mouth.

27
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,880
The air stops in the throat.

28
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,760
Then the teeth part and the tongue pulls down to release.

29
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,020
The word 'desk'.

30
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:03,860
The teeth closed and the tongue is at the roof of the mouth.

31
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:11,160
Then everything releases right into the EH as in Bed vowel.

32
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,480
The word 'stick'.

33
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:16,880
The teeth close and the tongue is at the roof of the mouth.

34
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:24,340
Then everything releases right into the IH as in Sit vowel.

35
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:26,760
The word 'expect'.

36
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:31,020
The teeth nearly close and the tongue is at the roof of the mouth.

37
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:34,660
Then the teeth release just a bit.

38
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:38,040
There's no next sound to release into.

39
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,880
So the movement is minimal for the release.

40
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:44,200
The tongue releases down.

41
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:49,840
It's possible to make the true D without the teeth coming together.

42
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,920
Said. Dd-- dd---

43
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:59,420
Because of the voice in this sound, we can still release it.

44
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:02,560
Said. Dd--

45
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,740
But to make the True T,

46
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:09,000
the teeth do have to come together or nearly together.

47
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,480
Set. Tt--

48
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:17,480
That was the True T and True D.

49
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:21,240
If the T or D are at the end of a sentence,

50
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:24,580
or if the next word begins with a consonant,

51
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:28,660
then you make a Stop T or  Stop D.

52
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:32,620
We stop the air, but we don't release it.

53
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:35,440
You lift your tongue into position,

54
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,920
stop the air, and that's it.

55
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:43,160
For example, the word 'mad', dd---

56
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:46,860
Mad-d-d-d--

57
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:51,440
Notice the last sound is d--

58
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,180
The beginning of the D, dd--

59
00:03:55,180 --> 00:04:00,220
with the vocal chords engaged because it's a voiced consonant.

60
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:03,560
I don't release.

61
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:09,120
A release would sound like this: mad-dd--

62
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,780
But instead, I say, mad-dd--

63
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:16,280
leaving my tongue tip up.

64
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:21,280
Now, let's look at an example with a T followed by another consonant.

65
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,800
The phrase "not for me".

66
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,700
Here, the T is followed by F.

67
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:31,220
I stop the air, not--

68
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:35,600
And then with out releasing, go into the F sound.

69
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,940
Not--for... not for me.

70
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:43,740
With stop consonants, we do stop the air in the throat.

71
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:49,800
So I don't have to move my tongue up into position for the T to stop the sound.

72
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,060
In this phrase,  "not for me",

73
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:58,000
I touch the roof of the mouth with a part of the tongue that's further back.

74
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,600
Not--

75
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,500
My tongue tip can stay down.

76
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,580
This helps me make the stop even shorter.

77
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:10,880
So I can quickly go in to the next sound.

78
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,480
Not for-- Not for--

79
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:18,660
I'll bring my tongue up for the Stop T if the next sound

80
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:22,920
also requires the tongue being at the roof of the mouth.

81
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:26,160
When I say "not for me",

82
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,240
instead of "noT for me".

83
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:33,560
The words are more connected and the sentence is smoother.

84
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:36,280
That's what we want in American English.

85
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:42,240
And that's why we use the Stop T instead of the True T in these cases.

86
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:48,700
Not for me.

87
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:53,760
Let's look at a stop up close and in slow motion.

88
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,240
Here's the word 'what'.

89
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,040
I don't release the T at the end.

90
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,860
The tongue goes to the roof of the mouth.

91
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:04,520
But then I just stop the air.

92
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:08,160
My teeth aren't together and I don't release.

93
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,980
The lips simply close: what--

94
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:15,740
Here's what it looks like with a True T.

95
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:20,520
The teeth come together, then a sudden release.

96
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:25,260
Compare the ending. The top is 'what' with a Stop T.

97
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:28,840
And the bottom is 'what' with a True T.

98
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:31,960
For the Stop T, the teeth don't come together

99
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,620
because they don't need to release.

100
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:38,240
The air simply stops with the tongue in position.

101
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:46,480
For the True T, we bring the teeth together  so the tongue, teeth, and air release.

102
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:51,380
The Stop T and D relate to the True T and D.

103
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:54,360
We simply skip the release.

104
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:58,680
But when the T or D come between 2 vowels or diphthongs,

105
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:02,320
or after an R and before a vowel or diphthong,

106
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,840
we make a different sound.

107
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:10,100
One exception, if the T or D starts a stressed syllable,

108
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:13,340
then it's a True T or D.

109
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:20,240
But in other cases, when the T or D consonants come between two vowels or diphthongs,

110
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,960
or after an R and before a vowel or diphthong,

111
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:27,040
we make a flap sound.

112
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:30,820
This is different from the True and Stop T and D

113
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:35,440
because we don't stop the sound, we don't hold anything.

114
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:40,180
We simply let the front part of the tongue bounce against the roof of the mouth

115
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:43,480
without stopping the flow of the air.

116
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:47,680
The Flap T and Flap D sound the same.

117
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:54,300
The Flap T and Flap D sound the same. 
The T in 'matter', is the same as the D in 'madder'.

118
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:58,160
Matter. Madder.

119
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,040
This sounds just like the R in many languages.

120
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:07,020
But in American English, it's the Flap T or Flap D.

121
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:11,260
In my videos, I use the D symbol for this sound.

122
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:15,840
This sound, however, isn't a stop consonant anymore.

123
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:21,220
Let's look at some words with a flap up close and in slow motion.

124
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:27,260
The word 'city'. Here the T comes between two vowel sounds so it's a flap.

125
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:31,140
The tongue is in position for the IH vowel.

126
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:35,260
Watch how it flaps against the roof of the mouth quickly.

127
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:37,660
The air doesn't stop.

128
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:41,540
mouth quickly. The air doesn't stop. That flap was fast even in slow motion.

129
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:43,340
Let's watch again.

130
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,440
The whole word one more time.

131
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:55,740
The word 'party'. Here, the T comes after an R and before a vowel.

132
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:59,720
So it's a flap. The tongue is back and up for the R.

133
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,720
Watch it flap.

134
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:05,240
And come down from the flap.

135
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:12,400
The air  didn't stop. Watch the whole word one more time.

136
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:17,900
The word 'tidy'. Here, the D comes after a diphthong and before a vowel

137
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:21,540
so it's a Flap D, watch the tongue flap.

138
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,760
The whole word one more time.

139
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:34,280
To isolate the sound, try holding out the sound before and after.

140
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:39,120
Party.

141
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:44,860
Then you can really feel the tongue flap bouncing against the roof of the mouth.

142
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:48,640
Remember, this isn't represented in dictionaries.

143
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,820
They will show the symbol for the True T: Party.

144
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:56,580
Even though Americans pronounce it 'party'.

145
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,400
So remember the rule.

146
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:02,560
When a T or D comes between vowels and diphthongs,

147
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:08,220
or after an R before a vowel or diphthong, like 'party',

148
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:14,200
unless it starts a stressed syllable, flap the tongue.

149
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,920
Sometimes, we drop the T or D completely.

150
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:21,960
We leave the sounds out. This is an American habit.

151
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:26,680
If you look up the words in the dictionary, the sounds are there.

152
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:33,140
There are two cases when you might hear an American drop a T or D.

153
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:38,180
First, when the T or D comes between two consonant sounds.

154
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:41,280
For example, 'exactly'.

155
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:46,780
This word has the K, T, L consonants together.

156
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:49,980
But most people pronounce it without the T.

157
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:51,820
Exactly.

158
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:55,660
Full pronunciation: exactly.

159
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:59,860
Common pronunciation: exactly.

160
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:05,920
Dropping the T between two consonants simplifies the pronunciation.

161
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:10,400
Also, we often drop the T when it comes after an N.

162
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:16,800
Many Americans say 'cenner' instead of 'center'.

163
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:23,220
Or 'innerview' instead of 'interview'.

164
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:25,580
This is a big topic.

165
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:33,600
I have a whole series of videos on the pronunciation of T and D which you can find on my website.

166
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,660
The True T and D sounds.

167
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:39,820
Desk

168
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:42,140
Stick

169
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:44,420
Expect

170
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:47,300
Stop T and D.

171
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,300
Mad

172
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,740
Not

173
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:54,000
What

174
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,140
The Flap T and D

175
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:59,480

176
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,860
Party

177
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:04,260
Tidy

178
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:07,740
Example words. Repeat with me:

179
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:15,480
Best. Tt-- Best.

180
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:24,900
Time. Tt-- Time.

181
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:33,180
Do. Dd-- do.

182
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:40,660
Odd. --dd. Odd.

183
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:44,580
There is no way to make a Stop T sound on its own

184
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:48,440
It's a lack of sound.

185
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:55,500
Cut

186
00:12:55,500 --> 00:13:02,300
Better. Ra-- Better.

187
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:08,740
This video is one of 36 in a new series, The Sounds of American English.

188
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:13,820
Videos in this set will be release here on YouTube twice a month.

189
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:19,140
first and third Thursdays in 2016 and 2017.

190
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:23,560
But the whole set can be all yours right now.

191
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:29,280
The real value of these videos is watching them as a set, as a whole,

192
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:34,360
to give your mind the time to take it all in an get the bigger picture.

193
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:41,120
Most of the materials you'll find elsewhere just teach the sounds on their own, in isolation.

194
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,820
It's a mistake to learn them this way.

195
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:50,000
We learn the sounds to speak words and sentences, not just sounds.

196
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,220
Move closer to fluency in spoken English.
