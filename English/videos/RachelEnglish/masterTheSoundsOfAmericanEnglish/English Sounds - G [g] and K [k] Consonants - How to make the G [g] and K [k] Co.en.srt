00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:06,140
In this American English pronunciation video,
we're going to learn how to pronounce the

2
00:00:06,149 --> 00:00:09,669
G and K consonant sounds.

3
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:22,720
These two sounds are paired together because
take the same mouth position.

4
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:28,460
Kk-- is unvoiced, meaning only air passes
through the mouth

5
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:37,280
and Gg-- is voiced, meaning you make a sound with the vocal cords. Gg--

6
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,560
These consonants are Stop Consonants which

7
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,140
means there are two parts to each sound.

8
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:49,650
First, a stop in the airflow and second, a release.

9
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:54,070
We stop the flow of air here, closing out vocal cords

10
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:59,570
while the back part of the tongue reaches up to touch the soft palate.

11
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:04,860
I'm going to slow down the K sound in the word 'back'.

12
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:10,360
See if you can hear the stop of air before the release.

13
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:15,580
Back-- back.

14
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:18,260
Here, you can see the tongue position.

15
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:23,510
The back of the tongue reaches up to touch
the soft palate which is closed.

16
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:31,210
The tip of the tongue can remain forward,
lightly touching the back of the bottom front teeth.

17
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:35,430
The jaw drops a little bit and the lips are open.

18
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:42,610
Kk-- Gg-- The lip position doesn't matter for these sounds.

19
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:49,540
So the lips might start forming the next sound like in the word 'great'.

20
00:01:49,540 --> 00:02:00,380
Here, the lips can start taking the position
for the R, as we make the G. Gg-- gg-- great.

21
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:05,200
Let's look at these sounds up close and in
slow motion.

22
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:10,580
The jaw drops and the back of the tongue lifts
to touch the soft palate,

23
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:14,760
then the tongue releases.

24
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:21,280
Sometimes, to make a sentence smoother, the
words more linked together,

25
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:25,190
native speakers will skip the release of a
Stop Consonant

26
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:28,290
when the next word begins with a consonant.

27
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:32,301
For example, the phrase 'back to work'.

28
00:02:32,301 --> 00:02:40,901
Back to-- back to-- I'm not saying back to-- kk--

29
00:02:40,901 --> 00:02:43,441
with the full release of the K.

30
00:02:43,441 --> 00:02:46,160
I'm holding the air for a fraction of a second

31
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:53,660
with my throat making that stop,
then I go right into the release of the T consonant.

32
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:58,780
Back to-- back to-- back to work.

33
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:05,840
Without the release of the K in 'back', the
two words flow together more easily,

34
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,920
making it smoother.

35
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:13,550
Notice I do make a light release of the K in the word 'work'.

36
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:15,430
Can you hear it?

37
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:17,830
Back to work.

38
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:22,130
Let's look at some words up close and in slow motion.

39
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:24,210
The word 'keep'.

40
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:29,070
Because the tongue lifts at the back, and
does not require much jaw drop,

41
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:33,000
it's hard to see this sound in this word.

42
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,770
The word 'green'.

43
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:41,230
The lips round for the G because they need
to round for the next sound, R.

44
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:46,330
The lip position doesn't change the G sound.

45
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:51,510
It's a little easier to see the back of the
tongue move when it's at the end of the word

46
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:53,849
like this word 'egg'.

47
00:03:53,849 --> 00:03:59,209
The tongue lifts in the back then releases.

48
00:03:59,209 --> 00:04:02,900
The G and K consonants.

49
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:05,120
Keep.

50
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,340
Green.

51
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:09,560
Egg.

52
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,379
Example words.

53
00:04:11,379 --> 00:04:13,299
Repeat with me.

54
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:15,320
Go.

55
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:21,480
Gg-- go.

56
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,780
Again.

57
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:28,740
Gg-- again.

58
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,840
Big.

59
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:36,040
Gg-- big.

60
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,521
Cry.

61
00:04:38,521 --> 00:04:44,420
Kk-- cry.

62
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:46,900
Key.

63
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:51,860
Kk-- key.

64
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:54,340
Black.

65
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:58,880
Kk-- black.

66
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:05,280
This video is one of 36 in a new series, The
Sounds of American English.

67
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:10,300
Videos in this set will be released here on
YouTube twice a month,

68
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:15,800
first and third Thursdays, in 2016 and 2017.

69
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:20,120
But the whole set can be all yours right now.

70
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:25,790
The real value of these videos is watching
them as a set, as a whole,

71
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:31,040
to give your mind the time to take it all
in and get the bigger picture.

72
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:37,830
Most of the materials you'll find elsewhere
just teach the sounds on their own in isolation.

73
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:40,400
It's a mistake to learn them this way.

74
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:46,440
We learn the sounds to speak words and sentences,
not just sounds.

75
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,759
Move closer to fluency in spoken English.
