1
00:00:00,859 --> 00:00:03,330
In this American English pronunciation

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:05,500
video, we’re going to learn how to

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:10,290
pronounce the EH as in BED vowel.

4
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:22,560
To make this sound, the jaw drops, eh,

5
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,689
and the tongue remains forward with

6
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:27,019
the tip touching lightly behind the

7
00:00:27,019 --> 00:00:31,470
bottom front teeth. Eh.

8
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:33,899
The mid/front part of the tongue lifts a

9
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:37,190
little bit towards the roof of the mouth

10
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:39,190
while the back of the tongue feels like it

11
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:42,140
stretches wide.

12
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:46,180
Eh. In a stressed syllable, the voice has

13
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:50,309
a little curve up, then curve down. Eh,

14
00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:56,170
eh. It’s stressed in the word ‘said’.

15
00:00:56,170 --> 00:01:01,640
Let’s watch up close and in slow motion.

16
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:04,580
The jaw drops. The tongue tip touches

17
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:07,340
the back of the bottom front teeth, and

18
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:09,560
the middle part arches up towards the

19
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:13,180
roof of the mouth.

20
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:20,820
Said, eh, said. In an unstressed syllable,

21
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:24,130
the vowel is lower and flatter in pitch,

22
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:29,100
as well as quieter and quicker, eh, eh.

23
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,720
The vowel is unstressed in the word

24
00:01:31,729 --> 00:01:37,470
‘employ’, eh. Let’s take a look up close

25
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:40,360
and in slow motion.

26
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:43,430
Relaxed jaw drop. The middle part of

27
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:45,530
the tongue arches up towards the roof

28
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:51,380
of the mouth. Here we compare the

29
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:55,770
stressed EH from ‘said’, on top, with the

30
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:58,829
unstressed version from ‘employ’ on

31
00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:02,360
the bottom. Notice the jaw drops more

32
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:05,829
for the stressed version of this vowel.

33
00:02:05,829 --> 00:02:08,030
Because the unstressed version of the

34
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:10,739
vowel is shorter, there isn’t enough

35
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:13,379
time to make the full jaw drop.

36
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:21,079
EH stressed: said, EH

37
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:27,520
EH unstressed: employ, eh

38
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:34,260
EH, eh. EH, eh.

39
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:38,380
Example words. Repeat with me:

40
00:02:38,380 --> 00:03:23,180
Red, never, embrace, enter, embody, desk.
