1
00:00:00,919 --> 00:00:03,419
In this American English pronunciation

2
00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:05,490
video, we’re going to learn how to

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:10,110
pronounce the UH as in BUTTER vowel.

4
00:00:17,289 --> 00:00:20,570
This is a very relaxed sound. You can

5
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:26,109
see, uh, the jaw drops but the rest of

6
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:31,910
the mouth remains very neutral, uh.

7
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:34,730
The tongue is relaxed: the back presses

8
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:39,840
down just a little bit, and the tip is forward.

9
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,710
Uh. Keep your face really relaxed.

10
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,649
Let’s look at this sound up close

11
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:48,580
and in slow motion.

12
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:52,699
A very relaxed jaw drop with relaxed lips.

13
00:00:52,699 --> 00:00:55,090
The tongue presses down just a bit in

14
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:58,730
the back. Here’s the word ‘stuff’.

15
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:03,399
Again, everything looks nice and relaxed.

16
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:05,059
The tongue presses down just

17
00:01:05,059 --> 00:01:09,079
a bit in the back.

18
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:12,060
In a stressed syllable, the vowel curves

19
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:19,299
up then down. Stuff, uh. In an unstressed

20
00:01:19,299 --> 00:01:22,819
syllable, it’s lower and flatter in pitch, and

21
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:28,680
a little quieter and quicker, uh, uh. The vowel

22
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:34,420
is unstressed in the word ‘undo’, uh.

23
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:37,280
Let’s take a look at this word up close

24
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:40,409
and in slow motion.

25
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:43,450
Easy jaw drop. Lips and cheeks remain

26
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:47,070
very relaxed. Tongue presses down

27
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:52,110
slightly in the back.

28
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:54,310
Compare the stressed vowel above

29
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:56,950
with the unstressed vowel below.

30
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,600
Notice the jaw may drop a bit more

31
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,770
for a stressed syllable.

32
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:06,030
This is typical. Unstressed vowels and

33
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:08,479
diphthongs are shorter, so there isn’t

34
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,259
as much time to make the full mouth position.

35
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:19,820
The UH vowel, stressed: stuff, UH

36
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:26,620
The UH vowel, unstressed: undo, uh

37
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:34,520
UH, uh, UH, uh.

38
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:38,140
Example words. Repeat with me.
