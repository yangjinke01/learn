00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,780
In this American English pronunciation video,

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:07,840
we're going to learn how to make the N consonant sound.

3
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:17,600
To make this sound, the jaw drops a little

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,040
and the lips part.

5
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:25,600
Nn-- The front flap part of the tongue goes to the roof

6
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,620
of the mouth.

7
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:30,080
Make sure to keep you tongue wide as you do that.

8
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,860
The soft palate is lowered.

9
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:37,100
Air comes up through the nasal passages.

10
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,940
This makes it a nasal consonant.

11
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:43,260
You can feel the vibration in your nose.

12
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,260
Nn--

13
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:49,760
There are only 3 nasal sounds in American English.

14
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:55,620
Nn-- Ng-- Mm--

15
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:00,100
It's very important that the tongue be relaxed.

16
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:06,500
If there is tension in the back of the tongue,
it will sound somewhat like the NG sound,

17
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:10,179
ng-- even if the front of the tongue is in the

18
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:12,320
right position.

19
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:18,900
One thing that will help relaxation is to
think about keeping the tongue really wide.

20
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:22,940
Nn-- nn--

21
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:28,440
Let's look up close and in slow motion.

22
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,160
The N sound.

23
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:35,440
Lips relaxed, tongue wide and lifted to the
roof of the mouth.

24
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:40,720
If you see any darkness on the sides of the tongue when you practice,

25
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,200
that means there is tension in the tongue.

26
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:48,360
Try to release that tension and keep the tongue wide.

27
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,660

28
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:56,020

Front of the tongue to roof of mouth.

31
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,620
The word 'on'.

32
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:13,000

the word.
