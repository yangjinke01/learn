00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:03,940
In this American English pronunciation video,

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:09,720
we’re going to learn how to pronounce the AY as in SAY diphthong.

3
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:19,650
Diphthongs are a combination of two sounds,

4
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:23,860
so they have a starting position and an ending position.

5
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:30,760
In the first position, the jaw drops and the tongue tip touches the back of the bottom front teeth.

6
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:34,920
The top of the tongue pushes forward and lifts a bit.

7
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,560
The second sound is the IH as in SIT vowel.

8
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:42,240
To transition into this position,

9
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:48,900
your jaw will lift as the top, front part of the tongue
arches towards the roof of the mouth.

10
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:53,620
Let’s look at a word with this sound, 'pay'.

11
00:00:53,620 --> 00:01:01,400
The jaw drops, and you can see a lot of tongue as
the front and middle push up and forward.

12
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:07,960
As the top, front part of the tongue arches up towards the roof of the mouth, the jaw comes up

13
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:12,900
Lips are relaxed for this diphthong.

14
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:16,840
AY, pay.

15
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:20,240
In a stressed syllable like ‘pay’,

16
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,120
the AY diphthong curves up then down.

17
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:28,180
Pay, ay.

18
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:32,740
In an unstressed syllable, it’s lower and flatter in pitch,

19
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:39,680
as well as quicker and quieter, ay, ay.

20
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:46,700
The diphthong is unstressed in the word ‘driveway’, ay.

21
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,900
Let’s take a look at this word.

22
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:53,720
Just as before, the jaw drops, and you can see a lot of tongue

23
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:57,780
as the front and middle push up and forward.

24
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:00,820
Then the top, front part of the tongue arches up

25
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:04,880
towards the roof of the mouth, and the jaw comes up.

26
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:10,440
Jaw drop may be a little less when this diphthong is in an unstressed syllable,

27
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:17,380
as we tend to simplify mouth movements in
unstressed syllables, which are shorter.

28
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:25,640
The AY diphthong, stressed: Pay, AY

29
00:02:25,649 --> 00:02:32,400
Unstressed: driveway, ay

30
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:39,940
AY, ay, AY, ay.

31
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:44,320
Example words. Repeat with me:

32
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:51,420
Okay. AY- Okay.

33
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:59,320
Play. AY- Play.

34
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:07,140
Operate. AY- Operate.

35
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:14,540
Gain. AY- Gain.

36
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:22,620
Separate. AY- Separate.

37
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:29,330
Pain. AY - Pain
