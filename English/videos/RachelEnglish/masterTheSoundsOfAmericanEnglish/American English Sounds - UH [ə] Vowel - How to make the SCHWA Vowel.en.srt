1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,409
In this American English pronunciation

2
00:00:03,409 --> 00:00:05,680
video, we’re going to learn how to

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,960
pronounce the schwa vowel sound.

4
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:19,940
This vowel is always unstressed. The

5
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:23,880
mouth position is a lot like the UH as in

6
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:27,250
BUTTER vowel, but that vowel can be

7
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:31,760
and usually is stressed. But just like that

8
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,969
vowel, everything in your lips, jaw, and

9
00:00:34,969 --> 00:00:38,590
neck should be relaxed for this sound.

10
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:41,309
Just slightly drop your jaw to make this

11
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:44,030
sound. The trick is to keep everything

12
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:46,380
else relaxed.

13
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,980
Let’s look at the vowel up close and in

14
00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:50,360
slow motion.

15
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,820
It’s possible to make this sound on its

16
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:56,460
own with just the slightest jaw drop. But

17
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,260
in actual words, you will likely see a bit

18
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:02,180
more jaw drop, like here, on the word

19
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:07,460
‘sofa’. Lips relaxed, cheeks relaxed,

20
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:10,650
tongue forward and relaxed.

21
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:13,909
As I said, this vowel can only be in an

22
00:01:13,909 --> 00:01:17,570
unstressed syllable. All other vowel and

23
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:20,640
diphthong sounds can either be stressed

24
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,140
or unstressed. So the schwa will always

25
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:29,670
be really fast and low in pitch. Uh, uh.

26
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:35,720
Sofa, uh. Ability, uh.

27
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,119
The schwa goes with the syllabic

28
00:01:38,119 --> 00:01:44,009
consonants L, M, N, and R. That means

29
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:46,579
when you have a syllable with a schwa

30
00:01:46,579 --> 00:01:49,149
followed by one of these consonants, you

31
00:01:49,149 --> 00:01:51,759
don’t need to make the schwa. It gets

32
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:54,700
absorbed by the next sound. For

33
00:01:54,700 --> 00:02:00,969
example, the word ‘father’: th-rr, th-rr.

34
00:02:00,969 --> 00:02:04,280
Just go from the TH sound right into the

35
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,670
R sound without trying to make a

36
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:12,040
separate schwa. Father, -ther.

37
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:20,060
The schwa: always unstressed. Uh, sofa,

38
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:26,060
uh, uh, ability, uh.

39
00:02:26,069 --> 00:02:29,189
Example words. Repeat with me:

40
00:02:29,189 --> 00:03:12,739
Allow, extra, data, again, visa, about.

41
00:03:12,739 --> 00:03:15,370
I hope this video helps you understand

42
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:18,840
this sound. That’s it, and thanks so much

43
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,080
for using Rachel’s English.
