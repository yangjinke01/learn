00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:06,370
In this American English Pronunciation video,
we're going to learn how to pronounce the

2
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:10,010
EW as in FEW diphthong.

3
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:20,380
Diphthongs are a combination of two sounds.

4
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:24,740
They have a starting position and an ending position.

5
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:28,520
The first sound is the Y consonant.

6
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:32,580
Diphthongs are normally made up of two vowel sounds.

7
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:37,400
But in this case, the Y consonant is acting as a vowel.

8
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,870
For example, in the word 'music'.

9
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:47,990
The Y sound goes with the OO vowel to make
a diphthong rather than with M consonant

10
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:50,630
to make a consonant cluster.

11
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:52,000
Music.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,780
To make the Y sound, the jaw drops a little bit.

13
00:00:55,780 --> 00:01:01,350
The lips may be relaxed or they may begin
rounding for the ending position.

14
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:06,220
The tongue tip is down, lightly touching the
back of the bottom front teeth.

15
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:11,910
The mid-front part of the tongue lifts and
touches the roof of the mouth about here.

16
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:17,050
It pushes forward against the roof of the
mouth before pulling away.

17
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:24,230
As we move the tongue on the roof of the mouth,
we close the vocal chords to get this sound...

18
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,600
which we add to the sound...

19
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:37,440
We release it the same time we release the tongue.

20
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:45,440
To transition into the next sound, we release
right into the position of the OO as in BOO vowel.

21
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,970
The tongue tip doesn't need to move.

22
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:51,360
It remains touching the back of the bottom front teeth.

23
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,980
The back part of the tongue lifts towards the soft palette.

24
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:58,620
The lips round.

25
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:04,060
Let's study a word with this sound: USE.

26
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:10,840
Jaw drops just a little bit as the tongue lifts and presses forward against the roof of the mouth.

27
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:16,770
The lips flare in preparation for the rounding
at the end of the diphthong.

28
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:23,280
Tongue releases, lifts in the back, and the lips round.

29
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:29,180
In a stressed syllable, the EW diphthong 
curves up then down.

30
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:30,959
Use.

31
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,040
Ew.

32
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:40,520
In an unstressed syllable, it's lower and
flatter in pitch as well as quieter and quicker.

33
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,090
Ew.

34
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:43,650
Ew.

35
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:48,060
The diphthong is unstressed in the word 'interview'.

36
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,260
Ew.

37
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:54,660
Let's take a look at the word 'interview'.

38
00:02:54,660 --> 00:03:00,920
A little bit of lip rounding in the first
position of the diphthong but in the ending

39
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:04,580
position, the lip rounding is subtle.

40
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:07,370
Not like in a stressed EW diphthong.

41
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:12,490
Let's compare the ending position
of the stressed EW diphthong above

42
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:15,480
with the unstressed diphthong below.

43
00:03:15,489 --> 00:03:19,829
In the stressed version, the lips round much more.

44
00:03:19,829 --> 00:03:25,640
Generally, the unstressed version of
a vowel or diphthong is more relaxed

45
00:03:25,649 --> 00:03:27,879
and doesn't take the full mouth position.

46
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:31,819
In this case, less lip rounding.

47
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:36,070
This is because we don't take this much
time for unstressed syllables.

48
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:41,560
They're shorter so we simplify the mouth movements.

49
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,560
EW stressed.

50
00:03:44,569 --> 00:03:47,269
Use.

51
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:49,609
EW.

52
00:03:49,609 --> 00:03:51,749
Unstressed.

53
00:03:51,749 --> 00:03:53,649
Interview.

54
00:03:53,649 --> 00:03:55,369
Ew.

55
00:03:55,369 --> 00:03:57,420
EW.

56
00:03:57,429 --> 00:03:59,449
Ew.

57
00:03:59,449 --> 00:04:01,449
EW.

58
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:03,229
Ew.

59
00:04:03,229 --> 00:04:04,902
Example words.

60
00:04:04,902 --> 00:04:06,962
Repeat with me.

61
00:04:06,962 --> 00:04:09,042
Music.

62
00:04:09,042 --> 00:04:11,422
EW.

63
00:04:11,422 --> 00:04:13,851
Music.

64
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:16,300
Continue.

65
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,520
Ew.

66
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:21,880
Continue.

67
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,140
Review.

68
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:26,400
EW.

69
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,580
Review.

70
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:32,020
Unite.

71
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,900
Ew.

72
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:37,180
Unite.

73
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:39,620
Union.

74
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,760
EW.

75
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,760
Union.

76
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:47,210
Future.

77
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:49,270
EW.
