00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:04,160
In this American English pronunciation video,

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:09,840
we're going to learn how to make the S and Z consonant sounds.

3
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:22,480
These two sounds are paired together because they take the same mouth position.

4
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:29,080
S is unvoiced, meaning only air passes through the mouth.

5
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:37,820
And Z is voiced, meaning, you make a sound with the vocal cords, Zz.

6
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:42,680
To make the sounds, the lips part and the corners pull back a little

7
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:46,620
while the teeth themselves likely touch.

8
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:50,360
Sss--, Zzz--

9
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:53,520
There are two ways to make these sounds.

10
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:59,960
One, with the tip of the tongue down, lightly touching the back of the bottom front teeth.

11
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:04,980
Or by pointing the tip of the tongue up.

12
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:08,400
You may find that the position of the tongue tip

13
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,440
depends on the sounds around the S and Z.

14
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:17,220
Let's look at these sounds up close and in slow motion.

15
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:21,140
The teeth lightly touch, tongue tip is down

16
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:25,280
and you can see a lot of tongue through the teeth.

17
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:34,380
Sit. Again, teeth lightly touch, the tongue tip is pointed down.

18
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:43,020
Miss. The tongue tip stays down as the teeth come together.

19
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:55,440
Fizz. This time, you'll see the tongue tip point up before the teeth close, and up.

20
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:58,960
The S and Z sounds.

21
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,960
Sip

22
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,260
Miss

23
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:05,260
Fizz

24
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:08,380
Example words. Repeat with me:

25
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:13,660
Note, the letter S can make the Z sound.

26
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:20,560
Some. Ss-- Some.

27
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:28,300
Must. Ss-- Must.

28
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:36,180
Less. Ss-- Less.

29
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:43,580
Zip. Zz-- Zip.

30
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:51,120
Cousin. Zz-- Cousin.

31
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:57,380
Easy. Zz-- Easy.

32
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:03,800
This video is one of 36 in a new series, The Sounds of American English.

33
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:14,140
Videos in this set will be released here on YouTube twice a month, first and third Thursdays, in 2016 and 2017.

34
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:18,480
But the  whole set can be all yours right now.

35
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:24,280
The real value of these videos is watching them as a set, as a whole,

36
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:29,400
to give your mind the time to take it all in and get the bigger picture.

37
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:36,040
Most of the materials you'll find elsewhere just teach the sounds on their own in isolation.

38
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,840
It's a mistake to learn them this way.

39
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:44,840
We learn the sounds to speak words and sentences, not just sounds.
