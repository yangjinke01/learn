00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:05,920
Seventy-seven Benevolent Elephants

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:11,840
I can’t do this one. Why practice tongue 
twisters? My students who have problems  

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:17,520
with some of the sounds in American English 
need to train their mind to guide their mouth,  

4
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,800
to effortlessly go through the positions for
these sounds. Tongue twisters can help with  

5
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:30,320
this. they can help build the brain connection: 
This is a T-H thhhh so that your body can do it  

6
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:36,080
on its own, without thinking of it, without the 
mind having to guide the tongue through the position. And  

7
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:41,760
that’s what we want of course. We want the habit. 
We want to take the sounds that are hardest,  

8
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:48,080
and make them effortless. So today we’re going 
to go over some tongue twisters to untwist  

9
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:54,126
your tongue and help you master some of the 
trickiest consonant sounds of American English.  

10
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:59,120

12
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:16,720
Today we’re training 3 super-tricky tongue 
twisters. First, Seventy-seven benevolent  

13
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:23,360
elephants. This is going to help with your V. My 
students from India and Germany tend to sometimes  

14
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:28,920
switch V and W, and these can be tricky 
sounds for other language groups as well.  

15
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:35,780
Mastering this tongue twister will help 
your brain really get that V is vvv.  
 

16
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:45,360
We’re also to do “which wristwatches are Swiss 
wristwatches?” Hitting the W hard, also the  

17
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:52,720
R. That’s because the W is silent in the word 
‘wrist’. Look out, this one is really tricky.  

18
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:57,295
And I’m not going to forget 
that ever important TH.  

19
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:04,440
“He threw three free throws” – you’ll 
get to work on R with that one too.  

20
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:08,378
What other tongue twisters do you know? 
Put them in the comments below.  
 

21
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:15,923
Let’s look at our first one, seventy-seven 
benevolent elephants. That’s a lot of elephants.  

22
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:22,400
Benevolent means kind, expressing goodwill, 
helping others. You usually don’t think of  

23
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:29,440
an elephant as being benevolent, but it does make a 
good tongue twister. This one is tricky. Too fast,  

24
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:35,298
and it even native speakers mess it up. This 
is my friend Ginny and her daughter Natalie.

25
00:02:35,298 --> 00:02:42,720
Seventy-seven Benevolent Elephants

26
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,960
And this is my sister-in-law Audrey.

27
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:51,280
Seventy-seven Benevolent Elephants

28
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,400
We’ll focus on the word ‘benevolent’. First,  

29
00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:00,400
it helps so much with a longer words to focus 
on stress. The second syllable here is stressed,  

30
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:12,387
let’s practice just that. Nev. Nev. It’s like 
a hill. Nev. Nev. It has our tricky V sound. V,  

31
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:24,831
not a W, no lip rounding. Nev, vvv. Next, 
unstressed. The first syllable is just ‘be,be’.  

32
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:32,160
Very simple, very fast. Let’s put it 
with the stressed syllable. Benev. Benev.  

33
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:38,240
Remember, these two syllables should feel totally 
different. One is stressed, one is unstressed.  

34
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:46,138
The first one is very fast, the second one is 
longer, it has that hill shape. Benev. Benev.  

35
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:51,360
Our other two syllables, -olent, -olent.  

36
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:57,623
All three of our unstressed syllables here 
have the schwa, pronounced like this ‘uh’.  

37
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,120
Can you believe that? Almost no jaw drop, totally 
relaxed face. It almost doesn’t even look like  

38
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:13,280
I’m not even talking. -olent, -olent, 
-olent. Benev - -olent. Benevolent.  

39
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:18,400
Put them together but don’t slow down 
those fast syllables. Keep them fast, keep  

40
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:27,433
it simple. Benevolent. Seventy-seven benevolent 
elephants, Seventy-seven benevolent elephants. 

41
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:35,338
The next word, elephants,that first syllable has 
the hill shape, the stress. Practice with me. El-.  

42
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:43,981
El-. The other two syllables, schwas, said more 
quickly. Ephant. Ephant. Ephant. Put it together,  

43
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:53,440
elephant. The PH makes an F sound. Did you know F 
and V have the same mouth position? F is unvoiced,  

44
00:04:53,440 --> 00:05:00,960
meaning just air makes the sound, ffff, and V 
Is voiced, meaning your vocal cords are engaged,  

45
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:13,040
making a sound. Vvvv. I’ll alternate. See that 
nothing in my mouth changes. Ff, vv, ff, vv.  

46
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:18,000
Let’s put the two words together. It’s going 
to be common to make the ending T a stop T.  

47
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,840
Stop the air in your throat, but don’t 
release tt, the T sound. Benevolent,  

48
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,482
benevolent. Benevolent elephants. Move your arm on 
those stressed syllables. Benevolent, benevolent,  

49
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:33,760
benevolent elephants. Okay, move your arm 
on those stressed syllables. Benevolent  

50
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:40,880
elephants, Benevolent elephants. Benevolent 
elephants. Do it as slowly as you need to,  

51
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,600
to make sure you’re doing it correctly. Remember, 
we want to train the right positions.  

52
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,640
Seventy-seven. This is going to help us 
train that V sound some more. Both parts  

53
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:58,560
of the word have first syllable stress. 
Seventy-seven. Seventy-seven. Notice I’m  

54
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:05,440
making that T more of a D, or a Flap T sound. 
This is an exception. Usually after N it’s  

55
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:12,560
either dropped or a True T. But here it’s 
a Flap T. Seventy-seven (flap). Seventy.  

56
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:20,480
Seventy-seven. Seventy-seven. Okay I’m going to 
try it now. Seventy-seven benevolent elephants.  

57
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:25,440
Seventy-seven benevolent elephants. 
If V is at all tricky sound for you,  

58
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:30,800
do this over and over. Slowly. Get it down 
good. This will help. Don’t go so fast that  

59
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,778
you’re doing it incorrectly. You want to practice 
doing it right, then you can speed it up.    

60
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:42,240
Our second tongue twister today is “which 
wristwatches are swiss wristwatches”.  

61
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,760
This one is so hard.

62
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:47,360
“which wristwatches are swiss wristwatches”.

63
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:55,040
I cannot do it quickly at all. Look at all these 
W and R sounds. W are in red, R in blue.  

64
00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:03,636
Beginning R and W actually look a lot a 
like from the outside. Watch: rrrrrr, wwwww.  

65
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:07,760
Lots of lip rounding. But what’s 
happening inside is pretty different.

66
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:13,200
For R, the middle part of the tongue lifts towards 
the roof of the mouth, the tip is back and up,  

67
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:18,640
not touching anything. For the W, the tongue 
tip touches the back of the bottom front teeth,  

68
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:25,440
then the back stretches up, and we have a little 
something extra in the throat. Wwww, just a little  

69
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:38,240
bit of a narrowing here. Wwww, Wwww wRrrrrist 
wwwwwatch. If R is at all a problem for you, or W,  

70
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:43,840
then nailing the tongue twister, slowing it down, 
getting it right, is going to help you out.  

71
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:54,800
Let’s do just the first two words: which wrist, 
which wrist. Both have the IH as in SIT vowel.  

72
00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:01,040
Which wrist, and the both have that hill 
shape, they’re both stressed. Which wrist,  

73
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:07,520
which wrist, which wrist, which 
wrist. Do that with me slowly: which  

74
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:14,640
wrist, which wrist. Let’s put in the 
second half of our compound word,  

75
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:21,840
‘watches’. IN a compound word, the first word 
is stressed. So Watches is unstressed, watches,  

76
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:29,600
watches, watches. It doesn’t have that hill 
shape, it’s flatter. Wrist watches. Wrist watches.  

77
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:38,560
Say that with me. Wrist watches, wrist watches. 
Which wrist watches, which wristwatches.  

78
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,080
By the way, this reminds me  

79
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:47,320
of another terribly hard tongue twister, 
“I wish to wash my Irish wristwatch.”  

80
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:54,557
I made my nieces and my niece’s fiancée try that 
one a couple of years ago, it was not pretty.

81
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:04,400
But this one, I think, is slightly easier. By 
the way, I’ll put the link to that other tongue  

82
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:10,320
twister video in my video description. 
Our next word is ‘are’. This word won’t  

83
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:16,560
be stressed. In fact in lots of sentences a 
native speaker would just say ‘er’. “Where  

84
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:25,418
are the kids?” Where are, er, er, er. For example, 
let’s try that. Just ‘er’ on the end of ‘watches.  

85
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:35,040
Which wrist watches are. Which wrist watches are. 
Watches are, watches are, watches are. Reducing  

86
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:43,120
are. Next, Swiss, we have another W. 
Lip rounding. Swiss, swiss. This is also  

87
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:50,206
stressed with that hill shape. A little bit 
longer. Swiss. Which wrist watches are Swiss.  

88
00:09:50,640 --> 00:10:00,640
Do it slowly and accurately. Which wristwatches 
are Swiss. Notice even when I’m going slowly,  

89
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:06,160
I’m still connecting all the words in that 
line. We want that. No breaks, no separation.  

90
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:14,965
All smoothly linked. That’s something we just 
love in English. Which wristwatches are Swiss.  

91
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:23,092
Now all we need is ‘wristwatches’ again. 
Which wristwatches are Swiss wrist watches?  

92
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:30,320
Which wristwatches are Swiss wristwatches? Have 
you got that? Take your time, do it daily.  
 

93
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,800
Okay, our third and final tongue 
twister that we’re practicing today  

94
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,744
is pretty tough. My sister-in-law 
and niece could not get it.

95
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:44,160
He threw three free throws.

96
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,720
He threw three free throws. 
Natalie couldn’t get it either.

97
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,200
He threw three free throws.

98
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,520
Not quite. Julia, nope.

99
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:56,640
He threw three free throws.

100
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,366
Let’s give Ginny a try.

101
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,169
He threw three free throws.

102
00:11:01,169 --> 00:11:03,520
(lauging) I’m so sorry.

103
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:09,440
She says no, she can’t do it. But you can 
do it. We can do it if we slow it down,  

104
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,360
get it good, and then speed 
up. And if you master this,  

105
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:19,120
your TH is going to be a lot clearer 
and THR would be way less intimidating.  
 

106
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,040
This one is extra tough because 
we’re dealing not just with TH and F,  

107
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:30,480
but with clusters with R. THREE, FREE. 
A lot of little kids can’t even say TH  

108
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,914
actually. They say F instead. I 
remember when my son Stoney did that.

109
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,800
Marf..

110
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:42,320
So you’re going Marf. You’re using your 
lip but we want to use your tongue.

111
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,544
No almost. Bring your tongue.  

112
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:52,895
He wasn’t very interested in learning that day. 
Was he? To make the unvoiced TH like threw,  

113
00:11:53,600 --> 00:12:00,720
three, and throws, your tongue tip 
has to come through the teeth. Th, th,  

114
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,950
just air. No tension, no holding, no stopping,  

115
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:12,391
th. Easy sound. Let’s alternate between three and free. 
I’ll zoom in. 

116
00:12:12,907 --> 00:12:20,693
Three, free, three, free,  

117
00:12:20,693 --> 00:12:31,280
three, free. You can do it. It takes practice, 
but you can get it. He threw. Let’s just do that.  

118
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:39,200
Threw is stressed. He threw, he threw. Three is 
also stressed, another THR cluster. So for the  

119
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:49,920
THR, you go from the tongue tip being out, th to 
being pulled back and up a little bit. Thr, thr.  

120
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,301
Slow it down, feel that movement 
at the tip of your tongue.  

121
00:12:53,301 --> 00:12:55,920
Thr

122
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:09,360
He threw three. He threw three. He 
threw three. Free is also stressed.  

123
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:16,824
Here you do want to use your bottom lip. 
Th, th, three. And then throws, unstressed.  

124
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:30,800
Free throws, free throws, free throws. Do that 
with me slowly. Free throws. You can hold out  

125
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:40,682
the consonant, really make sure you’re getting the 
right mouth position. He threw three free throws.  

126
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:46,800
Practicing slowly gives your mind time to guide 
your tongue into the right position. And once your  

127
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:51,646
brain does that enough, you won’t have to think 
about it anymore. The habit will be made.  
 

128
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,720
Our three tongue twisters today are all 
training problem consonant sounds in English  

129
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:02,160
for non-native speakers. Take your time. Get 
it right. Form the right pathway in the brain.  

130
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:09,440
You can do it. Seventy-seven benevolent elephants. 
Which wrist watches are Swiss wristwatches?  

131
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:16,480
He threw three free throws. And as you get more 
comfortable, you can increase your speed. Tongue  

132
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:21,280
twisters are actually kind of fun, aren’t they? 
Huge thanks to my friends and family for helping  

133
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:27,520
me out with this video, they’re not afraid of 
a few tongue twisters! Audrey, Emily, Molly,  

134
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:34,480
Taylor, Ginny, Natalie, and Julia, thank you.
