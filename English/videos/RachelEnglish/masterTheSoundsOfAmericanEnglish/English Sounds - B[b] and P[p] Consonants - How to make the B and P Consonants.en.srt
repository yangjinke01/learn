00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:06,140
In this American English pronunciation video,
we’re going to learn how to pronounce the

2
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:09,720
P and B consonants.

3
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:21,920
These two sounds are paired together
because they take the same mouth position.

4
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:28,900
P is unvoiced, pp, meaning only air
passes through the mouth.

5
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:39,220
And B is voiced, bb, meaning,
you make a sound with the vocal cords, bb.

6
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:42,830
The lips stay together while the teeth part a little.

7
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:46,190
The tongue position doesn’t matter for these consonants,

8
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:52,261
so the tongue can start to get into position
for the next sound.

9
00:00:52,261 --> 00:00:59,809
For example, if the next sound is the R consonant,
the tongue can move back and up for the R

10
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:05,369
while the lips close for the B, bring.

11
00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:09,829
Let’s see the sounds up close and in slow
motion.

12
00:01:09,829 --> 00:01:15,869
The lips press together, and then release.

13
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:18,529
These are stop consonants.

14
00:01:18,529 --> 00:01:21,790
In stop consonants, there are two parts.

15
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:25,480
There is a stop of the airflow, and a release.

16
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:30,020
The stop of the airflow happens as the lips close

17
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:33,100
Hap-pen.

18
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:44,260
The release is when the lips part and the
air comes through, -pen, hap-pen, happen.

19
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:49,480
Sometimes native speakers don’t release
stop consonants when they come at the end

20
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:55,090
of a sentence, or when the next word
 begins with a consonant.

21
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:59,800
For example, the common phrase ‘What’s up?’.

22
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:04,740
My lips closed in the P position,
but I didn’t release the air.

23
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,060
What’s up?

24
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:11,280
Another example: nap time!

25
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,009
Nap---time!

26
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:19,989
My lips came together for the P,
but they didn’t release the air.

27
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:27,300
I stopped the air with my lips, then released
it with the next sound, the T consonant.

28
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,420
Nap time.

29
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:33,760
Let’s look at some words up close and in
slow motion.

30
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,791
The word ‘best’.

31
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:43,099
The lips press together, and then release
into the EH as in BED vowel.

32
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:45,360
The word ‘spot’.

33
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:52,720
The lips press together, and then release
into the AH as in FATHER vowel.

34
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,401
The word ‘rip’.

35
00:02:54,401 --> 00:03:00,220
The lips press together, and then release.

36
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:10,319
The P and B consonants: best, spot, rip.

37
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:14,480
Example words. Repeat with me:

38
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:22,540
Bring

39
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:29,920
Baby

40
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:37,460
Job

41
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:44,800
Peace

42
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:53,040
Price

43
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:57,891
Up
