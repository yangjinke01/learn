1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,610
In this American English pronunciation

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:04,870
video, we’re going to learn how to

3
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:09,110
pronounce the EE as in SHE vowel.

4
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,600
This vowel is common to many

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,840
languages.

6
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:24,859
To make it, the jaw drops just a little bit.

7
00:00:24,859 --> 00:00:27,269
The tongue tip stays behind the bottom

8
00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:30,179
front teeth. The middle/front part of

9
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:32,550
the tongue arches up towards the roof

10
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:35,020
of the mouth, diminishing the space

11
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:37,030
between the tongue and the roof of the

12
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:39,000
mouth.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,210
The corners of the lips pull a little wide,

14
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:46,460
ee. They’re not quite relaxed.

15
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:50,000
Let’s see this sound up close and in

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,320
slow motion.

17
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,430
A little jaw drop, tongue tip down and

18
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:56,789
forward while the top front of the

19
00:00:56,789 --> 00:00:59,239
tongue arches towards the roof of the

20
00:00:59,239 --> 00:01:03,809
mouth. The corners of the lips pull out.

21
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:07,760
In the word ‘please’, the EE vowel is

22
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:13,040
stressed. Same position.

23
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,060
When stressed, the vowel has the up-

24
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:20,890
down shape of a stressed syllable: EE.

25
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:23,630
When unstressed, it’s lower and flatter

26
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:30,119
in pitch, quieter, and faster, ee. This is a

27
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:32,960
very common ending unstressed vowel

28
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,479
in American English because of all of

29
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:39,350
the words that end in Y, like the word

30
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:43,770
‘busy’. Let’s see this word up close and

31
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:47,580
in slow motion.

32
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:50,660
Jaw drops, top front of tongue arches

33
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:54,620
up, and the corners of the lips pull out.

34
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:57,040
Let’s compare the stressed EE in

35
00:01:57,049 --> 00:02:01,210
‘please’, on top, with the unstressed EE

36
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:04,759
in ‘busy’, on the bottom. You can see

37
00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:07,140
the mouth position for the unstressed

38
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:10,560
EE is a little more relaxed. The jaw

39
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,849
doesn’t drop as much.

40
00:02:13,849 --> 00:02:16,730
A more relaxed mouth position for the

41
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:18,629
unstressed version of a vowel or

42
00:02:18,629 --> 00:02:21,300
diphthong is very common because

43
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,849
they are shorter. So, there is less time

44
00:02:23,849 --> 00:02:27,640
to make the full mouth position.

45
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:36,640
Stressed EE: need, EE

46
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:43,880
Unstressed: busy, ee

47
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:52,180
EE, ee. EE, ee.

48
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:56,040
Example words. Repeat with me:

49
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:42,820
Keep, early, police, coffee, meet, each.
