00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:07,259
In this American English Pronunciation video,
we're going to compare the vowel and diphthong

2
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:09,719
sounds of American English.

3
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:22,920
You've already seen my set of 33 videos, 
The Sounds of American English.

4
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:28,771
In these videos, we went over the specifics
of the mouth position for each sound

5
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:34,240
including all of the vowel and 
diphthong sounds in American English.

6
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:40,700
In this video, we're going to do side by side
comparisons of vowel and diphthong sounds

7
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:42,660
that are similar.

8
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:49,200
Seeing how similar sounds are different should
help you solidify the individual sounds.

9
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,960
Let's get started.

10
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:04,680
Notice how the lips are completely relaxed
for AH but the corners pull back and up for AA.

11
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:13,760
AH

12
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,220
AA

13
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:22,100
AH

14
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:26,000
AA

15
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:36,520
Notice how there is more jaw drop for AH.

16
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,920
Press your tongue down in the back for this vowel.

17
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:49,680
AH

18
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,120
UH

19
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:57,640
AH

20
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,300
UH

21
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:13,160
Notice how the corners of the lips pull back
and up just a bit for the AA vowel.

22
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:16,010
This is the word 'sat'.

23
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:19,270
The lips are more relaxed for EH.

24
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:21,970
This is the word 'said'.

25
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:30,920
Sat

26
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:34,960
Said

27
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:38,740
Sat

28
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:42,080
Said

29
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:55,980
Notice how the lips are totally relaxed for
AH but flared a bit for AW.

30
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:05,200
AH

31
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,140
AW

32
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:13,510
AH

33
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:16,390
AW

34
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,800
IH has more jaw drop.

35
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:31,440
The tongue arches closer to the roof of the mouth in EE.

36
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:39,820
IH

37
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:44,980
EE

38
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:48,280
IH

39
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:52,140
EE

40
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,720
EH has more jaw drop.

41
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,380
This is the word 'said'.

42
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:11,140
In IH, the front part of the tongue arches
closer tot he roof of the mouth.

43
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:13,800
This is the word 'fix'.

44
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:23,980
Fix

45
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:28,180
Said

46
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:33,020
Fix

47
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:36,000
Said

48
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:46,280
The jaw drops less for EE.

49
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:50,900
Here, EE is in the word 'please'.

50
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:55,420
Notice how much the jaw drops for the first sound of AY.

51
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:58,820
This is the word 'pay'.

52
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:08,400
Pay

53
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,880
Please

54
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:17,600
Pay

55
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,340
Please

56
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:32,180
The jaw drops more for the first sound of
the diphthong in the word 'pay' but the tongue

57
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:34,960
is forward for both sounds.

58
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:40,480
Here, the IH vowel is in the word 'fix'.

59
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:45,930
The second half of the diphthong is the same
sound as the IH vowel.

60
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:49,410
But here, the jaw drops a little less.

61
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:59,680
Pay

62
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:05,040
Fix

63
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:10,060
Pay

64
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:13,480
Fix

65
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:26,231
The mouth position for the EH vowel in 'said'
looks identical to the first half of the diphthong

66
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:33,500
in 'pay' but look at the jaw for the second
position of the AY diphthong.

67
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,620
Less jaw drop.

68
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:59,360
Pay. Said.

69
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:11,820
Notice how the lips and mouth are totally
relaxed for the UH as in Butter vowel

70
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:17,100
but for the UR vowel, the lips flare
and the tongue is pulled back.

71
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:27,340
UH
UR

72
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:38,520
UH
UR

73
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:51,200
There is more jaw drop for the UH as in Butter
sound which is usually stressed than for the

74
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:54,379
schwa which is always unstressed.

75
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:58,020
Here, it looks like there's no jaw drop.

76
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:14,880
UH

77
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:24,780
The lips round much more for the OO vowel.

78
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:29,400
Flare them for the UH as in Push vowel.

79
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:47,720
UH
OO

80
00:08:53,200 --> 00:09:01,440
The lips flare a bit for the UH as in Push
vowel but are totally relaxed for the UH as

81
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:03,830
in Butter vowel.

82
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:21,780
UH

83
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:33,100
Remember to start your lips in a relaxed positionfor OO.

84
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:38,780
For the OH diphthong, the jaw drops a lot
for the beginning sound.

85
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:47,140
Then the lips make a tight circle for OO and
round but not as much for the second sound of OH.

86
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:12,080
OO
OH

87
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:25,320
The beginning position of OH looks a lot like
the AH vowel but the tongue pushes down in

88
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:28,000
the back for the AH vowel.

89
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:34,449
The ending position of the OH diphthong has
lip rounding but the lips are always relaxed

90
00:10:34,449 --> 00:10:37,089
for the AH vowel.

91
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:56,800
OH
AH

92
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:09,400
Notice how the corners of the lips pull back
for the first sound of the OW diphthong

93
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:13,400
but the lips flare for the AW vowel.

94
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:20,600
The jaw drops much less and the lips flare
a little for the second half of the OW diphthong.

95
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:26,640
The mouth position doesn't change for the AW vowel.

96
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:55,980
OW
AW

97
00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:03,100
Now, we'll see and say all those sounds and
words again, mixed up in a different order.

98
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:08,080
Say them with me in slow motion.

This video is one of 36 in a new series, The Sounds of American English.

134
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:07,160
Videos in this set will be released here on YouTube

135
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:13,900
twice a month, first and third Thursdays, in 2016 and 2017.

136
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:18,260
But the whole set can be all yours right now.

137
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:24,160
The real value of these videos is watching them as a set, as a whole,

138
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:29,240
to give your mind the time to take it all
in and get the bigger picture.

139
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:32,160
Most of the materials you'll find elsewhere

140
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,920
just teach the sounds on their own in isolation.

141
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,660
It's a mistake to learn them this way.

142
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:44,520
We learn the sounds to speak words and sentences, not just sounds.

143
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:48,040
Move closer to fluency in spoken English.
