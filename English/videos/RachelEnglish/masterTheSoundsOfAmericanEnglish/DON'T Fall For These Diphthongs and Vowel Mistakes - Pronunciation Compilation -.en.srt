00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:06,000
Today, we’re putting together every video
we have that focuses on the vowel and diphthong

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,040
sounds of American English.

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:09,920
This is your one-stop shop.

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:15,460
You’ll see photos, up-close slow-motion
words, valuable comparisons.

5
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:20,349
We’re going to talk a lot about word stress
too because that really affects vowel and

6
00:00:20,349 --> 00:00:21,349
diphthong sounds.

7
00:00:21,349 --> 00:00:26,779
You’re going to learn everything you need
to know about these American English sounds.

8
00:00:26,779 --> 00:00:34,910
We’ll start with the vowel AH like in father
and UH like in butter and we’ll see a comparison.

9
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:38,470
AH as in FATHER.

10
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:41,682
This vowel needs a lot of jaw drop.

11
00:00:41,682 --> 00:00:44,013
Ah.

12
00:00:44,013 --> 00:00:49,180
The tongue tip lightly touches behind the
bottom front teeth, and the back part of the

13
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:53,040
tongue presses down a little bit.

14
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:55,190
Ah.

15
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:59,249
The lips are neutral, very relaxed.

16
00:00:59,249 --> 00:01:00,716
Ah.

17
00:01:00,716 --> 00:01:06,140
Because the tongue presses down in the back,
you can see further into the dark space in

18
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:07,140
the mouth.

19
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:13,070
Let’s see that by watching this vowel up
close and in slow motion.

20
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:16,990
The lips are relaxed, and the tongue is lowered
in the back.

21
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:20,017
The inside of the mouth is dark.

22
00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:24,149
The word ‘job’.

23
00:01:24,149 --> 00:01:30,020
The jaw drops, and the tongue presses down
in the back.

24
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:32,380
Ah.

25
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:39,939
When this vowel is in a stressed syllable,
the voice will go up and come down in pitch,

26
00:01:39,939 --> 00:01:45,329
ah, job, ah.

27
00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:49,950
When it’s in an unstressed syllable, it
won’t be as long, and it won’t have the

28
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:55,729
up-down shape of the voice, ah, ah.

29
00:01:55,729 --> 00:02:04,126
For example, in the word ‘blockade’, ah,
ah, blockade.

30
00:02:05,233 --> 00:02:11,819
The mouth position looks the same: jaw drop,
relaxed lips, and tongue pressed slightly

31
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:13,810
down in the back.

32
00:02:16,588 --> 00:02:22,923
But because the pitch is flatter and the syllable
is quicker, it sounds unstressed.

33
00:02:22,923 --> 00:02:26,025
Ah, ah.

34
00:02:26,025 --> 00:02:32,815
Stressed AH: job, AH.

35
00:02:32,815 --> 00:02:39,349
Unstressed ah: blockade, ah.

36
00:02:39,349 --> 00:02:42,900
AH, ah.

37
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,533
AH, ah.

38
00:02:45,533 --> 00:02:47,680
Example words.

39
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,309
Repeat with me:

40
00:02:49,309 --> 00:02:56,400
Honest AH, Honest

41
00:02:57,489 --> 00:03:03,900
Occupation, ah, occupation

42
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:11,410
hot, AH, hot

43
00:03:12,989 --> 00:03:19,024
clock, AH, clock

44
00:03:20,331 --> 00:03:26,210
October, ah, October

45
00:03:27,517 --> 00:03:34,005
Soft, Ah, soft

46
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,030
The UH as in butter vowel

47
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:42,140
This is a very relaxed sound. 

48
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:53,799
You can see, uh, the jaw drops but the rest
of the mouth remains very neutral, uh.  

49
00:03:53,799 --> 00:04:00,400
The tongue is relaxed: the back presses down
just a little bit, and the tip is forward.

50
00:04:01,489 --> 00:04:02,836
Uh.

51
00:04:02,836 --> 00:04:05,909
Keep your face really relaxed.

52
00:04:05,909 --> 00:04:10,480
Let’s look at this sound up close and in
slow motion.

53
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,590
A very relaxed jaw drop with relaxed lips.

54
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:17,829
The tongue presses down just a bit in the
back.

55
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:20,590
Here’s the word ‘stuff’.

56
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:25,280
Again, everything looks nice and relaxed.

57
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:29,780
The tongue presses down just a bit in the
back.

58
00:04:30,709 --> 00:04:35,292
In a stressed syllable, the vowel curves up
then down.

59
00:04:35,292 --> 00:04:38,971
Stuff, uh.

60
00:04:40,169 --> 00:04:45,734
In an unstressed syllable, it’s lower and
flatter in pitch, and a little quieter and

61
00:04:45,734 --> 00:04:49,637
quicker, uh, uh.

62
00:04:49,637 --> 00:04:55,350
The vowel is unstressed in the word ‘undo’,
uh.

63
00:04:56,004 --> 00:05:01,210
Let’s take a look at this word up close
and in slow motion.

64
00:05:01,809 --> 00:05:04,120
Easy jaw drop.

65
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,334
Lips and cheeks remain very relaxed.

66
00:05:07,334 --> 00:05:11,111
Tongue presses down slightly in the back.

67
00:05:13,453 --> 00:05:18,675
Compare the stressed vowel above with the
unstressed vowel below.

68
00:05:18,675 --> 00:05:23,443
Notice the jaw may drop a bit more for a stressed
syllable.

69
00:05:24,292 --> 00:05:25,940
This is typical.

70
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:31,450
Unstressed vowels and diphthongs are shorter,
so there isn’t as much time to make the

71
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:34,370
full mouth position.

72
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:48,266
The UH vowel, stressed: stuff, UH
The UH vowel, unstressed: undo, uh

73
00:05:48,266 --> 00:05:55,370
UH, uh, UH, uh.

74
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:58,229
Example words.

75
00:05:58,229 --> 00:05:59,661
Repeat with me.

76
00:05:59,661 --> 00:06:06,358
Sometimes, UH, sometimes

77
00:06:08,209 --> 00:06:13,989
money, UH, money

78
00:06:16,276 --> 00:06:21,950
above, UH, above

79
00:06:22,822 --> 00:06:28,149
untie, UH, untie 

80
00:06:30,218 --> 00:06:35,704
uphill, UH, uphill

81
00:06:36,304 --> 00:06:42,209
Fun, UH, fun.

82
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,449
Here we have the AH and uh vowels in profile.

83
00:06:49,449 --> 00:06:55,780
You can see for the Ah vowel the jaw might
drop a little bit more.

84
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:59,889
Also the tongue position has a little bit
of tension in it.

85
00:06:59,889 --> 00:07:03,789
That’s because the tongue is flattened a
little bit.

86
00:07:03,789 --> 00:07:07,768
In the uh vowel the tongue is completely relaxed.

87
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:15,000
Now you’ll see the mouth from the front
alternating between the AH and the uh sounds.

88
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,639
Watch the subtle change in jaw drop.

89
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:22,103
And see if you can notice the subtle change
in tongue position as well.

90
00:07:23,628 --> 00:07:25,351
AH

91
00:07:25,351 --> 00:07:27,237
Uh

92
00:07:27,237 --> 00:07:29,667
AH

93
00:07:29,667 --> 00:07:32,261
Uh

94
00:07:32,261 --> 00:07:34,256
AH

95
00:07:34,256 --> 00:07:35,706
Uh

96
00:07:35,706 --> 00:07:41,250
Now we’ll do two other vowel sounds that
I’ve noticed can be tricky for my students.

97
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:43,067
Set.

98
00:07:43,067 --> 00:07:44,176
Sat.

99
00:07:44,176 --> 00:07:49,240
I’m talking about the EH as in bed vowel
and the AA vowel like in bat.

100
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:53,550
We’ll go over each sound in-depth and have
a comparison.

101
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:57,990
the EH as in BED vowel.

102
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:05,680
To make this sound, the jaw drops, eh, and
the tongue remains forward with the tip touching

103
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,903
lightly behind the bottom front teeth.

104
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,580
Eh.

105
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:17,620
The mid/front part of the tongue lifts a little
bit towards the roof of the mouth while the

106
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:21,060
back of the tongue feels like it stretches
wide.

107
00:08:21,986 --> 00:08:23,619
Eh.

108
00:08:23,619 --> 00:08:29,740
In a stressed syllable, the voice has a little
curve up, then curve down.

109
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:32,740
Eh, eh.

110
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:36,570
It’s stressed in the word ‘said’.

111
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:40,890
Let’s watch up close and in slow motion.

112
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:43,570
The jaw drops.

113
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:49,070
The tongue tip touches the back of the bottom
front teeth, and the middle part arches up

114
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:51,103
towards the roof of the mouth.

115
00:08:53,118 --> 00:08:58,740
Said, eh, said.

116
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:06,000
In an unstressed syllable, the vowel is lower
and flatter in pitch, as well as quieter and

117
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,262
quicker, eh, eh.

118
00:09:09,262 --> 00:09:14,800
The vowel is unstressed in the word ‘employ’,
eh.

119
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:19,937
Let’s take a look up close and in slow motion.

120
00:09:19,937 --> 00:09:22,860
Relaxed jaw drop.

121
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:26,987
The middle part of the tongue arches up towards
the roof of the mouth.

122
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:38,940
Here we compare the stressed EH from ‘said’,
on top, with the unstressed version from ‘employ’

123
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:41,010
on the bottom.

124
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:45,584
Notice the jaw drops more for the stressed
version of this vowel.

125
00:09:45,584 --> 00:09:51,750
Because the unstressed version of the vowel
is shorter, there isn’t enough time to make

126
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,804
the full jaw drop.

127
00:09:53,804 --> 00:10:00,455
EH stressed: said, EH

128
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:07,062
EH unstressed: employ, eh

129
00:10:07,879 --> 00:10:11,259
EH, eh.

130
00:10:11,259 --> 00:10:13,994
EH, eh.

131
00:10:13,994 --> 00:10:16,430
Example words.

132
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:18,169
Repeat with me:

133
00:10:18,768 --> 00:10:25,939
Red, EH, Red

134
00:10:26,538 --> 00:10:33,005
Never, EH, never

135
00:10:33,659 --> 00:10:40,418
embrace, Eh, embrace

136
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:46,632
enter, EH, enter

137
00:10:48,211 --> 00:10:53,931
embody, EH, embody

138
00:10:55,075 --> 00:11:01,342
Desk, EH, desk.

139
00:11:01,832 --> 00:11:06,360
The AA as in BAT vowel.

140
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:10,810
This is a sound that changes depending on
the following sound.

141
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:15,540
So, it can either be a pure vowel or a modified
vowel.

142
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:19,000
We’ll go over both in this video.

143
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:25,970
To make the pure AA vowel, the jaw drops quite
a bit, AA.

144
00:11:26,209 --> 00:11:32,589
The tip of the tongue stays forward; it’s
touching the back of the bottom front teeth,

145
00:11:32,589 --> 00:11:33,959
AA.

146
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:37,100
The back part of the tongue stretches up.

147
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:40,832
The tongue is wide, AA.

148
00:11:40,832 --> 00:11:46,711
Because the tongue is high in the back and
low in the front, you can see a lot of it.

149
00:11:46,711 --> 00:11:52,970
This is different from the 'ah' as in 'father'
vowel, for example, where the tongue presses

150
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:57,283
down in the back and you see more dark space
in the mouth.

151
00:11:57,719 --> 00:12:02,224
AA, AH.

152
00:12:02,224 --> 00:12:08,220
You can also see the corners of the mouth
pull back and up a little bit.

153
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:10,388
AA.

154
00:12:10,388 --> 00:12:16,720
Let’s take a look at the pure AA vowel up
close and in slow motion.

155
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,875
The tongue tip is down and the back of the
tongue lifts.

156
00:12:22,673 --> 00:12:25,120
Here’s the word ‘sat’.

157
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:33,140
The tongue position is easy to see because
of the jaw drop needed for this vowel.

158
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:42,180
When AA is in a stressed syllable, the vowel
will go up and come down in pitch, AA.

159
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:45,820
Sat, AA.

160
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:54,100
In an unstressed syllable, the vowel is flatter
and lower in pitch, quieter, aa.

161
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:59,106
This vowel is unstressed in the second syllable
of ‘backtrack’.

162
00:12:59,106 --> 00:13:02,490
Let’s look up close and in slow motion.

163
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:09,190
In the first, stressed syllable, the jaw drops,
and we see the corners of the lips pull back

164
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:12,071
and up for the stressed AA.

165
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:15,920
In the unstressed syllable, the jaw drops
less.

166
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,510
Let’s compare them.

167
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:21,030
On top is the stressed AA.

168
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:23,940
You can see the jaw drops more.

169
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:28,970
For the unstressed AA, the corners of the
lips are a little more relaxed than in the

170
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:33,019
stressed version, where they pull slightly
back and up.

171
00:13:33,019 --> 00:13:38,621
Generally, the unstressed version of a vowel
or diphthong is more relaxed and doesn’t

172
00:13:38,621 --> 00:13:45,000
take the full mouth position, in this case,
a little less jaw drop, and relaxed lips.

173
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:51,065
This is because unstressed syllables are shorter,
so we don’t take the time to make the full

174
00:13:51,065 --> 00:13:52,294
position.

175
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:58,912
At the beginning of this video, I said the
AA vowel is not always a pure AA.

176
00:13:58,912 --> 00:14:03,413
This vowel changes when it’s followed by
a nasal consonant.

177
00:14:03,413 --> 00:14:11,180
When it’s followed by the M or N sounds,
the tongue relaxes in the back, making an

178
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:13,880
UH sound after AA.

179
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,658
AA-UH.

180
00:14:15,658 --> 00:14:19,000
It’s not a pure AA sound.

181
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:25,096
Unfortunately, this change is not represented
in the International Phonetic Alphabet.

182
00:14:25,096 --> 00:14:29,230
It’s still written with the same AA symbol.

183
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:36,889
So, you just have to know when it’s followed
by  m or n, it’s different.

184
00:14:36,889 --> 00:14:43,660
We don’t say ‘man’, aa, ‘man’, with
a pure AA.

185
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:52,870
We say ‘man’, aa-uh, aa-uh, relaxing the
tongue and corners of the lips before the

186
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:54,630
consonant.

187
00:14:54,630 --> 00:15:01,257
You can think of this UH relaxation as the
‘uh’ as in ‘butter’ sound or schwa

188
00:15:01,257 --> 00:15:02,093
sound.

189
00:15:02,529 --> 00:15:09,199
Let’s look up close and in slow motion at
the word ‘exam’.

190
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:15,220
First we see the familiar shape of the mouth,
when the AA is in a stressed syllable.

191
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:21,350
Watch how the relaxation that happens: the
corners of the lips relax in.

192
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:25,509
The tongue will relax down in the back.

193
00:15:25,509 --> 00:15:28,696
And the lips close for the M consonant.

194
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,449
This relaxation of the corner of the lips
and back of the tongue happens when the AA

195
00:15:35,449 --> 00:15:39,209
vowel is followed by the N consonant as well.

196
00:15:39,209 --> 00:15:42,198
For example, the word ‘hand’.

197
00:15:42,198 --> 00:15:44,500
Haa-uhnd.

198
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,555
Hand.

199
00:15:47,555 --> 00:15:55,389
So, when you see this symbol followed by this
symbol or this symbol, it’s no longer a

200
00:15:55,389 --> 00:15:56,829
pure AA.

201
00:15:56,829 --> 00:16:01,699
Think of relaxing out of the vowel, AA-UH.

202
00:16:01,699 --> 00:16:07,149
If the next sound is the NG consonant, it’s
a little different.

203
00:16:07,149 --> 00:16:13,391
Rather than ‘aa-uh’, the vowel changes
into AY.

204
00:16:13,391 --> 00:16:18,040
It’s really like the AY as in SAY diphthong.

205
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:23,822
First, the middle part of the tongue lifts
towards the roof of the mouth, then the front

206
00:16:23,822 --> 00:16:25,470
part of the tongue.

207
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:31,334
Let’s watch ‘gang’ up close and in slow
motion.

208
00:16:31,334 --> 00:16:36,579
The position for the first sound looks a lot
like AA, but the part of the tongue lifting

209
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:38,299
up is more forward.

210
00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:41,622
Gaaaang.

211
00:16:41,622 --> 00:16:46,540
Then the front part of the tongue arches up
towards the roof of the mouth, while the tongue

212
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:50,279
tip remains down.

213
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:56,160
When you see this symbol followed by this
symbol, it’s no longer a pure AA.

214
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,510
It’s more like AY.

215
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:01,785
Gang.

216
00:17:02,384 --> 00:17:05,105
Thanks.

217
00:17:05,105 --> 00:17:12,160
Pure stressed AA: Sat, aa

218
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:18,518
Pure unstressed AA: backtrack, aa

219
00:17:18,518 --> 00:17:24,658
AA, aa, AA, aa.

220
00:17:24,658 --> 00:17:31,268
AA vowel modified by M: exam, aa-uh

221
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:39,278
AA vowel modified by N: man, aa-uh

222
00:17:39,278 --> 00:17:47,116
AA vowel modified by NG: gang, ay

223
00:17:47,116 --> 00:17:49,320
Example words.

224
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,650
Repeat with me:

225
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:56,798
Chapter, AA, Chapter

226
00:17:57,942 --> 00:18:04,085
can, AA, can

227
00:18:05,283 --> 00:18:10,895
act, AA, act

228
00:18:10,895 --> 00:18:18,200
last, AA , last

229
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:24,797
bank, ay, bank

230
00:18:25,777 --> 00:18:32,112
Bypass, aa, bypass

231
00:18:36,626 --> 00:18:43,350
Here you’ll see the EH as in bed vowel on
the left and the AA as in bat vowel on the

232
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:44,740
right.

233
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:49,420
For the AA vowel, you can see that it’s
the back part of the tongue that raises up

234
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,060
towards the roof of the mouth.

235
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:56,541
For the EH vowel, it’s the mid front part
of the tongue that is stretching up.

236
00:18:56,541 --> 00:19:01,700
Also for the AA, you can see that the jaw
drops just a little bit more.

237
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:05,860
So, for the AA vowel, the tongue is raising
here.

238
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:06,860
AA

239
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:10,030
And for the EH vowel, the tongue is raising
more here.

240
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:11,030
EH

241
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:17,190
So here for the AA and here for the EH.

242
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:18,630
AA

243
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:19,630
EH

244
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:24,520
When comparing the two sounds in isolation,
you’ll also notice that the jaw does not

245
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:30,020
drop as much for the EH sound as the front
part of the tongue is raising towards the

246
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:31,400
roof of the mouth.

247
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,440
AA

248
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,232
EH

249
00:19:35,485 --> 00:19:38,820
There’s a difference in the lip position
as well.

250
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:43,530
For the AA vowel, you may find that you may
get a more accurate sound if you lift a little

251
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:45,642
bit here with the top left.

252
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:49,540
AA, AA.

253
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:54,230
Whereas for the EH sound the lips remain very
relaxed and neutral.

254
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:57,038
EH, EH.

255
00:19:57,038 --> 00:20:00,838
Now we’ll see the two alternating upclose.

256
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,220
AA

257
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:06,132
EH

258
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:09,460
AA

259
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:12,090
EH

260
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:15,000
To close, a few minimal pairs.

261
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,382
Bat

262
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,765
Bet

263
00:20:19,636 --> 00:20:21,671
Capped

264
00:20:21,889 --> 00:20:23,739
Kept

265
00:20:23,739 --> 00:20:25,710
Jam

266
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:27,146
Gem

267
00:20:27,636 --> 00:20:29,498
Tack

268
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:31,860
Tech

269
00:20:32,296 --> 00:20:33,988
Rack

270
00:20:34,478 --> 00:20:35,549
Wreck

271
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:39,340
Next we have another pair that’s tricky
for my students.

272
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:43,816
EE like in seat and IH like in sit.

273
00:20:43,816 --> 00:20:48,850
We’ll go over each sound in depth and then
I’ll talk about length when it comes to

274
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:49,900
vowel sounds.

275
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:54,170
The EE as in SHE vowel.

276
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:57,751
This vowel is common to many languages.

277
00:20:58,265 --> 00:21:02,660
To make it, the jaw drops just a little bit.

278
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:06,171
The tongue tip stays behind the bottom front
teeth.

279
00:21:06,171 --> 00:21:12,150
The middle/front part of the tongue arches
up towards the roof of the mouth, diminishing

280
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:15,874
the space between the tongue and the roof
of the mouth.

281
00:21:16,201 --> 00:21:21,300
The corners of the lips pull a little wide,
ee.

282
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:24,270
They’re not quite relaxed.

283
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:29,030
Let’s see this sound up close and in slow
motion.

284
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:36,240
A little jaw drop, tongue tip down and forward
while the top front of the tongue arches towards

285
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,150
the roof of the mouth.

286
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:41,660
The corners of the lips pull out.

287
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:47,300
In the word ‘please’, the EE vowel is
stressed.

288
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:48,900
Same position.

289
00:21:50,589 --> 00:21:58,166
When stressed, the vowel has the up-down shape
of a stressed syllable: EE.

290
00:21:58,166 --> 00:22:06,361
When unstressed, it’s lower and flatter
in pitch, quieter, and faster, ee.

291
00:22:06,905 --> 00:22:13,290
This is a very common ending unstressed vowel
in American English because of all of the

292
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:18,170
words that end in Y, like the word ‘busy’.

293
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:25,520
Let’s see this word up close and in slow
motion.

294
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:32,050
Jaw drops, top front of tongue arches up,
and the corners of the lips pull out.

295
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:40,339
Let’s compare the stressed EE in ‘please’,
on top, with the unstressed EE in ‘busy’,

296
00:22:40,339 --> 00:22:41,720
on the bottom.

297
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:47,910
You can see the mouth position for the unstressed
EE is a little more relaxed.

298
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:50,225
The jaw doesn’t drop as much.

299
00:22:51,042 --> 00:22:58,640
A more relaxed mouth position for the unstressed
version of a vowel or diphthong is very common

300
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,920
because they are shorter.

301
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:04,893
So, there is less time to make the full mouth
position.

302
00:23:04,893 --> 00:23:20,232
Stressed EE: need, EE
Unstressed: busy, ee

303
00:23:21,376 --> 00:23:24,950
EE, ee.

304
00:23:25,386 --> 00:23:28,961
EE, ee.

305
00:23:29,505 --> 00:23:31,800
Example words.

306
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,110
Repeat with me:

307
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:40,129
Keep, EE, Keep

308
00:23:41,491 --> 00:23:47,447
Early, EE, Early

309
00:23:49,953 --> 00:23:56,541
Police, EE, police

310
00:23:57,794 --> 00:24:04,168
Coffee, ee, coffee

311
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:11,808
meet, EE, meet

312
00:24:13,224 --> 00:24:19,668
Each, EE, each

313
00:24:19,668 --> 00:24:24,110
The IH as in sit vowel.

314
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:28,170
This vowel can be a challenge for non-native
speakers.

315
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:33,540
The tendency is to replace it with the EE
vowel.

316
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:40,560
But for the IH vowel, the jaw drops more,
so the tongue isn’t as close to the roof

317
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,700
of the mouth.

318
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:44,860
Let’s study the mouth position.

319
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:47,860
There’s a relaxed jaw drop.

320
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:53,850
The tip of the tongue stays forward, lightly
touching the back of the bottom front teeth.

321
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:58,740
The top, front part of the tongue arches up
towards the roof of the mouth.

322
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:03,668
Let’s see this vowel up close and in slow
motion.

323
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:06,100
Relaxed jaw drop.

324
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:07,740
Tongue tip forward.

325
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:13,160
Top, front part of the tongue arches up towards
the roof of the mouth.

326
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:17,155
This vowel is stressed in the word ‘fix’.

327
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:20,408
Same mouth position.

328
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:32,602
When this vowel is in a stressed word or syllable,
like ‘fix’, it has an up-down shape, IH,

329
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:36,326
fix, IH.

330
00:25:36,326 --> 00:25:42,940
When it’s in an unstressed syllable, it
will be flatter and lower in pitch, quieter:

331
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:46,120
ih, ih.

332
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:50,880
It’s unstressed in the word ‘office’,
ih.

333
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,584
Let’s take a look.

334
00:25:53,584 --> 00:25:58,860
The mouth position is the same, but a little
more relaxed.

335
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:08,510
Let’s compare the stressed IH in ‘fix’,
on the top, to the unstressed IH in ‘office’.

336
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:13,129
Notice that the jaw is more dropped for the
stressed syllable.

337
00:26:13,129 --> 00:26:17,843
For the unstressed IH, the jaw is less dropped.

338
00:26:18,823 --> 00:26:21,340
This is typical.

339
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:27,394
Unstressed vowels are shorter, so there isn’t
as much time to make the full mouth position.

340
00:26:27,394 --> 00:26:33,756
Stressed IH: fix, IH

341
00:26:33,756 --> 00:26:39,012
Unstressed IH: office, ih

342
00:26:40,046 --> 00:26:46,588
IH, ih, IH, ih

343
00:26:47,623 --> 00:26:49,900
Example words.

344
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,516
Repeat with me:

345
00:26:52,333 --> 00:26:58,857
Which, IH, which

346
00:26:58,857 --> 00:27:07,917
instead, Ih, instead

347
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:15,000
begin, IH, begin

348
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:21,997
divorce, Ih, divorce

349
00:27:21,997 --> 00:27:29,125
busy, IH, busy

350
00:27:29,125 --> 00:27:35,274
Print, IH, print

351
00:27:39,167 --> 00:27:44,521
Here along the Hudson River for fleet week,
they are bringing out some old-time replica

352
00:27:44,521 --> 00:27:45,521
ships.

353
00:27:45,902 --> 00:27:49,918
Like the ones taken in this photo by my friend
Jovan.

354
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:53,650
And this made me think about the vowels IH
and EE.

355
00:27:53,650 --> 00:28:01,278
Ships has the IH as in sit vowel and fleet,
week both have both have the EE as in she

356
00:28:01,278 --> 00:28:02,169
vowels.

357
00:28:02,169 --> 00:28:08,186
Now I just did a video on the IH vowel versus
the EE vowel, a comparison.

358
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:10,359
And I didn’t talk about length at all.

359
00:28:10,359 --> 00:28:13,964
That’s because I don’t think length really
comes into play when we’re talking about

360
00:28:13,964 --> 00:28:15,355
a vowel on its own.

361
00:28:15,355 --> 00:28:19,985
But since a lot of people teach length when
they teach these two vowels, I thought I should

362
00:28:19,985 --> 00:28:21,530
talk about it.

363
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:26,950
A lot of people will say that EE is a long
vowel and Ih is a short vowel.

364
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:30,990
But I feel like vowels themselves don’t
have a length.

365
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:35,160
To me the length of a syllable depends on
is a distressed syllable or is unstressed.

366
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:42,100
So if the Ih vowel is in the stressed syllable
of a content word, then it would be long even

367
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:45,000
though some people would call it short vowel.

368
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,700
Another thing that can affect vowel length
is the ending consonant.

369
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:54,450
If everything else is the same and the ending
consonant is voiced, then that vowel will

370
00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:58,000
be a little bit longer than if the ending
consonant is unvoiced.

371
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:04,190
So, for example the word cap will be a little
bit shorter than the word cab.

372
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:06,075
Cap

373
00:29:06,075 --> 00:29:07,642
Cab

374
00:29:07,642 --> 00:29:13,110
So in looking at the EE vowel and the IH vowel
in the word beat.

375
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:17,032
An unvoiced consonant there at the end, that
EE vowel is short.

376
00:29:17,032 --> 00:29:18,195
Beat.

377
00:29:18,195 --> 00:29:23,820
But in the word bid, the ending consonant
there is voiced so IH will be a little bit

378
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:24,820
longer.

379
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:28,840
So don’t think about the length of the vowel
being tied to the vowel itself.

380
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:34,900
It’s tied to the syllable and the sentence
position and maybe the ending consonant.

381
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:36,765
This ship was interesting.

382
00:29:36,765 --> 00:29:42,050
Because instead of raising their sails, they
had people standing where the sails would

383
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:45,950
have been.

384
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:52,891
Notice how been spelled with two e’s is
actually pronounced with the IH as in sit

385
00:29:52,891 --> 00:29:54,219
vowel.

386
00:29:54,219 --> 00:29:55,703
Listen again.

387
00:29:55,703 --> 00:30:01,109
where the sails would have been.

388
00:30:10,968 --> 00:30:12,656
Hey Jovan

389
00:30:12,709 --> 00:30:13,663
Yeah

390
00:30:13,718 --> 00:30:14,579
Nice socks.

391
00:30:14,579 --> 00:30:15,310
Thanks.

392
00:30:15,363 --> 00:30:16,579
I really like them.

393
00:30:16,633 --> 00:30:19,950
Thanks, that means a lot.

394
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:25,610
Now you’ll see videos that go into the details
of all the remaining vowel and diphthong sounds.

395
00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:30,060
Then we’ll compare the mouth positions for
the different sounds.

396
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:33,751
the AW as in LAW vowel.

397
00:30:33,751 --> 00:30:41,830
This vowel sound, when pure, is quite similar
to the AH as in FATHER vowel.

398
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:47,030
In some areas of the United States, we don’t
even make this sound.

399
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:51,996
We always use the AH as in FATHER sound instead.

400
00:30:51,996 --> 00:30:57,750
Also, when this vowel is followed by the R
consonant, it changes.

401
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:59,635
We’ll go over that.

402
00:30:59,635 --> 00:31:03,565
First let’s study the mouth position.

403
00:31:03,565 --> 00:31:08,770
To make this vowel, the jaw drops and the
tongue shifts back.

404
00:31:08,770 --> 00:31:11,539
The tip of the tongue doesn’t touch anything.

405
00:31:11,539 --> 00:31:13,918
The lips flare a bit.

406
00:31:14,598 --> 00:31:16,210
AW.

407
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:22,290
One technique that might help you make this
sound is to think of the cheeks coming in

408
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:27,554
and shifting forward just a little bit, aw.

409
00:31:27,554 --> 00:31:35,200
This is a way to make it different from the
AH as in FATHER vowel, where the lips and

410
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,264
cheeks are totally relaxed.

411
00:31:38,571 --> 00:31:42,734
AW, AH.

412
00:31:43,061 --> 00:31:46,709
Let’s watch up close and in slow motion.

413
00:31:46,709 --> 00:31:52,950
The jaw drops, the lips flare out a little
bit, and the tongue pulls back.

414
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:59,130
Let’s compare with the AH as in FATHER vowel,
on top.

415
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:02,300
In AH, the lips are relaxed.

416
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:05,693
In AW, the lips flare.

417
00:32:05,693 --> 00:32:12,043
Also notice how the tongue pulls back in the
AW vowel.

418
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:18,893
In a stressed syllable, this vowel has the
up-down shape of stress.

419
00:32:18,893 --> 00:32:20,970
AW.

420
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:22,230
AW.

421
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:26,149
For example, in the word ‘saw’.

422
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:35,610
Jaw drops, lips flare, tongue shifts back.

423
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:42,410
In an unstressed syllable, the voice will
be lower in pitch, quieter, and flatter.

424
00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:49,380
Unstressed syllables won’t be as long, aw,
aw.

425
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:52,120
AW, aw.

426
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:59,640
The voice is unstressed in the word ‘on’,
a function word, on.

427
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:04,460
Function words are unstressed, aw, aw.

428
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:11,370
Note, this word can also be pronounced with
the AH as in FATHER vowel.

429
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:17,010
The vowel here is extremely quick since it’s
in an unstressed syllable.

430
00:33:17,010 --> 00:33:20,700
The tongue tip isn’t quite forward.

431
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:26,510
The tongue is in position just an instant
before the tongue flips up to make the N.

432
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:37,481
Let’s compare the stressed AW in SAW, on
top, with the unstressed AW in ‘on’, on

433
00:33:37,481 --> 00:33:39,640
the bottom.

434
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:45,231
You can see the jaw drops less, the lips are
more relaxed, and the tongue doesn’t shift

435
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:46,715
back as much.

436
00:33:46,715 --> 00:33:53,380
Unstressed syllables are shorter than stressed
syllables, so often the unstressed version

437
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:59,282
of a vowel or diphthong doesn’t take the
full mouth position of the stressed version.

438
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,128
This vowel can be affected by following consonants.

439
00:34:04,128 --> 00:34:10,370
When the AW vowel is followed by the R consonant,
the sound does change.

440
00:34:10,370 --> 00:34:16,271
The lips flare more, and the tongue pulls
back more, and up a little bit.

441
00:34:16,271 --> 00:34:23,040
This is because we blend the position for
the R with the position for the AW when the

442
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,412
R follows the AW.

443
00:34:25,412 --> 00:34:38,147
Instead of AW, the sound is aw, core, aw,
aw, AW.

444
00:34:38,637 --> 00:34:40,905
Let’s look at another word.

445
00:34:40,905 --> 00:34:51,817
Sore, aw, aw, sore, aw, AW.

446
00:34:51,817 --> 00:35:01,127
Let’s compare the pure AW with the AW followed
by R, in the word ‘quarter’, on the bottom.

447
00:35:01,127 --> 00:35:08,575
You can see for the AW followed by R, the
lips round more and the jaw drops less.

448
00:35:08,575 --> 00:35:14,460
Because of the lips, it’s hard to see the
tongue, but it pulls back and up more than

449
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:17,930
in a pure AW vowel, above.

450
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:24,268
Pure stressed AW: saw, AW

451
00:35:24,268 --> 00:35:31,312
Pure unstressed AW: on, aw

452
00:35:31,312 --> 00:35:37,499
AW, aw, AW, aw

453
00:35:37,825 --> 00:35:46,240
AW modified by R: core, aw, aw.

454
00:35:46,893 --> 00:35:49,000
Example words.

455
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,406
Repeat with me.

456
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:57,729
Boss, AW, boss

457
00:35:58,383 --> 00:36:05,705
long, AW, long

458
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:12,801
runoff, aw, runoff

459
00:36:13,836 --> 00:36:19,884
lifelong, aw, lifelong

460
00:36:20,591 --> 00:36:27,259
login, AW, login

461
00:36:29,329 --> 00:36:35,408
wrong, AW, wrong

462
00:36:37,423 --> 00:36:39,667
Daughter.

463
00:36:39,667 --> 00:36:43,110
AW, daughter

464
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:45,918
The schwa vowel sound.

465
00:36:46,284 --> 00:36:49,622
This vowel is always unstressed.

466
00:36:49,622 --> 00:36:57,780
The mouth position is a lot like the UH as
in BUTTER vowel, but that vowel can be and

467
00:36:57,780 --> 00:37:00,306
usually is stressed.

468
00:37:00,306 --> 00:37:07,060
But just like that vowel, everything in your
lips, jaw, and neck should be relaxed for

469
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:08,126
this sound.

470
00:37:08,126 --> 00:37:12,540
Just slightly drop your jaw to make this sound.

471
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:15,780
The trick is to keep everything else relaxed.

472
00:37:16,292 --> 00:37:20,340
Let’s look at the vowel up close and in
slow motion.

473
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:26,600
It’s possible to make this sound on its
own with just the slightest jaw drop.

474
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:32,251
But in actual words, you will likely see a
bit more jaw drop, like here, on the word

475
00:37:32,251 --> 00:37:33,532
‘sofa’.

476
00:37:33,532 --> 00:37:40,193
Lips relaxed, cheeks relaxed, tongue forward
and relaxed.

477
00:37:40,193 --> 00:37:45,910
As I said, this vowel can only be in an unstressed
syllable.

478
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:52,394
All other vowel and diphthong sounds can either
be stressed or unstressed.

479
00:37:52,394 --> 00:37:57,700
So the schwa will always be really fast and
low in pitch.

480
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:59,670
Uh, uh.

481
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:02,021
Sofa, uh.

482
00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:05,299
Ability, uh.

483
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:15,000
The schwa goes with the syllabic consonants
L, M, N, and R. That means when you have a

484
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:21,510
syllable with a schwa followed by one of these
consonants, you don’t need to make the schwa.

485
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:24,810
It gets absorbed by the next sound.

486
00:38:24,810 --> 00:38:30,856
For example, the word ‘father’: th-rr,
th-rr.

487
00:38:30,856 --> 00:38:39,050
Just go from the TH sound right into the R
sound without trying to make a separate schwa.

488
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:42,440
Father, -ther.

489
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:46,180
The schwa: always unstressed.

490
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:55,781
Uh, sofa, uh, uh, ability, uh.

491
00:38:55,781 --> 00:38:58,040
Example words.

492
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,418
Repeat with me:

493
00:38:59,418 --> 00:39:04,960
Allow, uh, allow

494
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:11,868
extra, uh, extra

495
00:39:13,285 --> 00:39:19,059
data, uh, data

496
00:39:20,964 --> 00:39:26,895
again, uh, again

497
00:39:28,474 --> 00:39:34,038
visa, uh, visa

498
00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:41,966
About, uh, about

499
00:39:41,966 --> 00:39:46,012
The OO as in BOO vowel.

500
00:39:46,012 --> 00:39:50,634
This sound is a little different from all
of the other vowel sounds.

501
00:39:50,634 --> 00:39:57,510
Other vowel sounds have one mouth position,
EE, for example.

502
00:39:57,510 --> 00:40:02,910
And it’s the position of the tongue, lips,
and jaw that make the sound.

503
00:40:02,910 --> 00:40:08,380
For this vowel, the movement into and out
of the position is just as important as the

504
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:12,248
position itself, ih-oo.

505
00:40:12,248 --> 00:40:14,780
We’ll talk about that in a second.

506
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:18,384
First, let’s take a look at the mouth position.

507
00:40:18,384 --> 00:40:24,240
To make this sound, the back part of the tongue
stretches up towards the soft palate.

508
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:30,250
The front part of the tongue remains down,
lightly touching, or just behind, the bottom

509
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:31,730
front teeth.

510
00:40:32,002 --> 00:40:36,270
I'm sure you can see the lips round a lot.

511
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:41,720
We want to begin this sound with lips that
are more relaxed to move into this tighter

512
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:43,140
lip position.

513
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:47,580
Let’s take the word ‘do’ as an example.

514
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:51,390
The lip position doesn’t matter for the
D sound.

515
00:40:51,390 --> 00:40:57,210
The lips can start moving into the position
for the next sound when making the D, like

516
00:40:57,210 --> 00:41:00,371
in the consonant cluster ‘drop’.

517
00:41:00,970 --> 00:41:06,236
Did you see how my lips were already forming
the R when I made the D?

518
00:41:06,563 --> 00:41:08,910
Drop.

519
00:41:08,910 --> 00:41:16,050
So what happens when we make the lip position
for OO as we make the D sound?

520
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:19,286
Du, du.

521
00:41:19,286 --> 00:41:26,030
That’s not the right sound, do, du.

522
00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:32,540
To make the right American OO sound, the lips
have to start out, more relaxed, and then

523
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:35,190
come into this tight circle.

524
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:40,780
This transition into position for the sound
is just as important as the position itself.

525
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:45,040
Let’s see up close and in slow motion.

526
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:50,790
Lips start in a bigger flare, more relaxed,
before moving into the tighter circle.

527
00:41:50,790 --> 00:41:54,889
Look at how much the corners of the lips come
in for this sound.

528
00:41:54,889 --> 00:41:58,658
Now let’s take a look at the word ‘do’.

529
00:41:58,658 --> 00:42:04,400
Remember, we don’t want to start with the
lips in a tight circle, but in a more relaxed

530
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:07,658
position so they can move into the tight circle.

531
00:42:07,658 --> 00:42:11,780
Then lips move from the flare into the tighter
circle.

532
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:18,030
It might help to think to think of this sound
as ih-oo, starting with a more relaxed lip

533
00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:20,090
position.

534
00:42:20,090 --> 00:42:21,650
Ih-oo.

535
00:42:21,650 --> 00:42:30,284
In a stressed syllable, you have an up-down
shape in the voice, OO, OO.

536
00:42:30,284 --> 00:42:36,360
In an unstressed syllable, the pitch will
be flatter and lower, and it will be quieter

537
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:39,594
and quicker, oo, oo.

538
00:42:39,594 --> 00:42:46,200
The OO vowel is unstressed in the word ‘visual’,
oo.

539
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:50,770
Let’s take a look up close and in slow motion.

540
00:42:50,770 --> 00:42:55,334
Often, unstressed vowels have a more relaxed
lip position.

541
00:42:55,334 --> 00:43:02,250
Notice that, for the oo vowel, the lips do
still come into a tight circle.

542
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:07,636
The OO vowel stressed: do, OO

543
00:43:07,636 --> 00:43:15,030
The OO vowel unstressed: visual, oo

544
00:43:15,030 --> 00:43:21,555
OO, oo, OO, oo.

545
00:43:21,555 --> 00:43:23,710
Example words.

546
00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:25,231
Repeat with me:

547
00:43:25,231 --> 00:43:31,200
Blue, OO, Blue

548
00:43:31,962 --> 00:43:37,322
issue, oo, issue

549
00:43:38,357 --> 00:43:44,108
suit, oo, suit

550
00:43:44,599 --> 00:43:50,794
move, OO, move

551
00:43:51,611 --> 00:43:57,642
influence, oo, influence

552
00:43:58,350 --> 00:44:00,696
Two.

553
00:44:00,696 --> 00:44:04,110
OO, two

554
00:44:04,110 --> 00:44:08,590
The UR as in BIRD sound.

555
00:44:08,590 --> 00:44:14,570
I sometimes say this is the vowel version
of the R consonant.

556
00:44:14,570 --> 00:44:19,840
It's always followed by R, and there's no
distinction between the sounds in American

557
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:21,019
English.

558
00:44:21,019 --> 00:44:26,570
This sound will always be written with two
different International Phonetic Alphabet,

559
00:44:26,570 --> 00:44:35,853
or IPA, symbols, but will be pronounced rrrrrr,
just one sound, bird.

560
00:44:36,292 --> 00:44:42,420
To make this sound, the corners of the lips
come in, pushing the lips away from the face.

561
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:46,880
The middle part of the tongue lifts towards
the roof of the mouth in the middle.

562
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:51,190
The front of the tongue hangs down, but it's
drawn back a bit.

563
00:44:51,190 --> 00:44:53,939
So, it's not touching anything.

564
00:44:54,376 --> 00:44:59,910
As the tongue lifts in the middle, it may
be close to the roof of the mouth without

565
00:44:59,910 --> 00:45:06,990
touching it, or it may touch the sides of
the roof of the mouth, or the insides or bottom

566
00:45:06,990 --> 00:45:12,560
of the top teeth, here, ur, ur.

567
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:20,320
This, along with the R consonant, is one of
the hardest sounds to make in American English.

568
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:25,980
It’s especially hard because the lip position
hides the tongue position.

569
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:27,835
Let’s take a look.

570
00:45:27,835 --> 00:45:31,460
From the side, we can’t even see the tongue.

571
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:34,280
The front view doesn’t help much either.

572
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:39,210
This is because the tongue goes back, but
the lips flare forward.

573
00:45:39,537 --> 00:45:42,283
Here’s the word ‘hurt’.

574
00:45:42,283 --> 00:45:45,000
Watch the tongue pull back and up 

575
00:45:50,718 --> 00:45:53,971
before coming forward for the T.

576
00:45:54,709 --> 00:46:00,000
In a stressed syllable, the UR vowel curves
up then down.

577
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,494
Hurt, ur.

578
00:46:03,494 --> 00:46:11,460
In an unstressed syllable, it’s lower in
pitch, as well as quieter and quicker, ur,ur. 

579
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:18,255
The vowel is unstressed in the word ‘research’,
ur.

580
00:46:18,255 --> 00:46:22,826
Let’s take a look at this word up close
and in slow motion.

581
00:46:22,826 --> 00:46:27,170
The lips flare, but the jaw doesn’t drop
as much.

582
00:46:27,170 --> 00:46:35,660
Let’s compare the stressed UR in ‘hurt’,
on the top, with the unstressed vowel in ‘research’,

583
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:37,060
on the bottom.

584
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:42,800
The lips flare for both, but in this case,
there was much more jaw drop for the stressed

585
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,793
version of this vowel.

586
00:46:44,793 --> 00:46:46,895
This is typical.

587
00:46:46,895 --> 00:46:54,011
Unstressed vowels are shorter, so there isn’t
as much time to make the full mouth position.

588
00:46:54,011 --> 00:47:01,952
The UR vowel, stressed: hurt, UR

589
00:47:01,952 --> 00:47:07,889
Unstressed: research, ur

590
00:47:08,434 --> 00:47:15,416
UR, ur, UR, ur

591
00:47:16,233 --> 00:47:18,330
Example words.

592
00:47:18,330 --> 00:47:21,160
Repeat with me:

593
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:28,054
Earth, UR, Earth

594
00:47:29,198 --> 00:47:35,820
search, UR, search

595
00:47:37,073 --> 00:47:43,650
circle, UR, circle

596
00:47:45,883 --> 00:47:52,614
thirteen, us, thirteen

597
00:47:54,575 --> 00:48:01,196
return, UR, return

598
00:48:02,939 --> 00:48:08,970
Outburst, ur, outburst.

599
00:48:09,514 --> 00:48:14,042
The UH as in PUSH vowel.

600
00:48:14,042 --> 00:48:21,879
To make this sound, the corners of the lips
come in a little so the lips flare away from

601
00:48:21,879 --> 00:48:24,710
the face, UH.

602
00:48:24,710 --> 00:48:29,366
The back of the tongue lifts towards the back
of the roof of the mouth.

603
00:48:29,366 --> 00:48:35,360
The front of the tongue remains down, but
it might be pulled slightly back, so it’s

604
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:39,460
not quite touching the back of the bottom
front teeth.

605
00:48:39,460 --> 00:48:44,459
Let’s look at this sound up close and in
slow motion.

606
00:48:44,459 --> 00:48:51,100
The lips flare and the tongue inside the mouth
is a little darker than on other vowels because

607
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:53,220
the tongue is pulled back.

608
00:48:53,819 --> 00:48:56,460
Here’s the word ‘took’.

609
00:48:56,460 --> 00:48:59,820
The corners of the mouth come in to flare
the lips.

610
00:48:59,820 --> 00:49:04,449
The back of the tongue lifts, and the front
pulls back a little.

611
00:49:06,042 --> 00:49:11,540
In a stressed syllable, the vowel curves up
then down.

612
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:15,400
Took, uh.

613
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:22,740
In an unstressed syllable, it’s lower and
flatter in pitch, as well as quieter and quicker.

614
00:49:22,740 --> 00:49:28,820
The vowel is unstressed in the word ‘good-bye’,
uh, uh.

615
00:49:28,820 --> 00:49:32,860
Let’s look at this word up close and in
slow motion.

616
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:38,300
Again, the lips flare and the tongue lifts
in the back, pulling back the front of the

617
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:39,188
tongue.

618
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:46,810
Let’s compare the stressed version on top
with the unstressed version on the bottom.

619
00:49:46,810 --> 00:49:53,571
Notice the lips flare a little less for the
unstressed vowel, hiding the bottom teeth.

620
00:49:54,170 --> 00:50:00,220
Generally, the unstressed version of a vowel
or diphthong is more relaxed and doesn’t

621
00:50:00,220 --> 00:50:06,820
take the full mouth position, in this case,
a little less lip flare, and possibly less

622
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:07,941
jaw drop.

623
00:50:07,941 --> 00:50:14,220
This is because unstressed syllables are shorter,
so we don’t take the time to make the full

624
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:15,760
mouth position.

625
00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:23,820
The stressed UH: took, UH

626
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:29,432
Unstressed: good-bye, uh

627
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:33,152
UH, uh.

628
00:50:33,152 --> 00:50:36,872
UH, uh.

629
00:50:37,798 --> 00:50:39,750
Example words.

630
00:50:39,750 --> 00:50:41,801
Repeat with me:

631
00:50:41,801 --> 00:50:48,544
Could, UH, could

632
00:50:49,470 --> 00:50:56,540
Book, UH, book

633
00:50:57,629 --> 00:51:03,600
Firewood, uh, Firewood

634
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:09,530
Sugar, UH, sugar

635
00:51:11,218 --> 00:51:17,530
Childhood, uh, Childhood

636
00:51:19,490 --> 00:51:25,324
Woman, UH, woman

637
00:51:25,324 --> 00:51:29,418
The AY as in SAY diphthong.

638
00:51:29,418 --> 00:51:35,720
Diphthongs are a combination of two sounds,
so they have a starting position and an ending

639
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:36,720
position.

640
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:42,330
In the first position, the jaw drops and the
tongue tip touches the back of the bottom

641
00:51:42,330 --> 00:51:44,020
front teeth.

642
00:51:44,020 --> 00:51:48,230
The top of the tongue pushes forward and lifts
a bit.

643
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:52,990
The second sound is the IH as in SIT vowel.

644
00:51:52,990 --> 00:51:59,550
To transition into this position, your jaw
will lift as the top, front part of the tongue

645
00:51:59,550 --> 00:52:01,880
arches towards the roof of the mouth.

646
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:06,376
Let’s look at a word with this sound, ‘pay’.

647
00:52:06,376 --> 00:52:13,969
The jaw drops, and you can see a lot of tongue
as the front and middle push up and forward.

648
00:52:13,969 --> 00:52:19,920
As the top, front part of the tongue arches
up towards the roof of the mouth, the jaw

649
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:21,560
comes up.

650
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:25,460
Lips are relaxed for this diphthong.

651
00:52:25,460 --> 00:52:30,290
AY, pay.

652
00:52:30,290 --> 00:52:37,900
In a stressed syllable like ‘pay’, the
AY diphthong curves up then down.

653
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:41,619
Pay, ay.

654
00:52:41,619 --> 00:52:49,710
In an unstressed syllable, it’s lower and
flatter in pitch, as well as quicker and quieter,

655
00:52:49,710 --> 00:52:53,210
ay, ay.

656
00:52:53,210 --> 00:52:58,910
The diphthong is unstressed in the word ‘driveway’,
ay.

657
00:52:58,910 --> 00:53:02,710
Let’s take a look at this word.

658
00:53:02,710 --> 00:53:08,410
Just as before, the jaw drops, and you can
see a lot of tongue as the front and middle

659
00:53:08,410 --> 00:53:11,310
push up and forward.

660
00:53:11,310 --> 00:53:16,030
Then the top, front part of the tongue arches
up towards the roof of the mouth, and the

661
00:53:16,030 --> 00:53:18,400
jaw comes up.

662
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:24,410
Jaw drop may be a little less when this diphthong
is in an unstressed syllable, as we tend to

663
00:53:24,410 --> 00:53:30,000
simplify mouth movements in unstressed syllables,
which are shorter.

664
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:37,976
The AY diphthong, stressed: Pay, AY

665
00:53:38,575 --> 00:53:44,587
Unstressed: driveway, ay

666
00:53:45,241 --> 00:53:52,411
AY, ay, AY, ay.

667
00:53:52,901 --> 00:53:55,380
Example words.

668
00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:57,081
Repeat with me:

669
00:53:57,081 --> 00:54:03,401
Okay, AY, Okay

670
00:54:04,871 --> 00:54:11,562
Play, AY, Play

671
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:18,535
Operate, ay, Operate

672
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:26,430
Gain, AY, Gain

673
00:54:27,465 --> 00:54:33,938
Separate, ay, Separate

674
00:54:36,008 --> 00:54:42,256
Pain, AY, Pain

675
00:54:42,746 --> 00:54:46,709
the AI as in BUY diphthong.

676
00:54:46,709 --> 00:54:53,230
Diphthongs are a combination of two sounds,
so they have a starting position and an ending

677
00:54:53,230 --> 00:54:54,690
position.

678
00:54:54,690 --> 00:54:59,670
In the first position, the jaw is more dropped
than the second position.

679
00:54:59,670 --> 00:55:03,340
The back of the tongue stretches up a little
bit.

680
00:55:03,340 --> 00:55:08,597
As the mouth moves into the second position,
the jaw drops less as the front part of the

681
00:55:08,597 --> 00:55:12,660
tongue arches up towards the roof of the mouth.

682
00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:18,109
For both the beginning and the end of this
diphthong, the tongue tip touches the back

683
00:55:18,109 --> 00:55:19,980
of the bottom front teeth.

684
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:25,900
Let’s watch up close and in slow motion,
where you can really see the front part of

685
00:55:25,900 --> 00:55:28,350
the tongue arching up.

686
00:55:28,350 --> 00:55:33,880
The jaw drops and the front part of the tongue
stays down, with the tip touching the back

687
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:35,840
of the bottom front teeth.

688
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:41,350
Immediately the tongue moves into the second
position, the top front arching up towards

689
00:55:41,350 --> 00:55:43,060
the roof of the mouth.

690
00:55:43,060 --> 00:55:46,250
As the tongue arches up, there’s less jaw
drop.

691
00:55:46,250 --> 00:55:49,500
Here’s the word ‘hi’.

692
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:56,520
Jaw drops with the front of the tongue down,
then the jaw lifts as the front of the tongue

693
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:59,910
arches towards the roof of the mouth.

694
00:55:59,910 --> 00:56:05,800
In a stressed syllable, the AI diphthong curves
up then down.

695
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:09,340
Hi, AI.

696
00:56:09,340 --> 00:56:16,830
In an unstressed syllable, it’s lower and
flatter in pitch, as well as quicker and quieter,

697
00:56:16,830 --> 00:56:19,780
ai, ai.

698
00:56:19,780 --> 00:56:25,050
The diphthong is unstressed in the word ‘idea’,
ai.

699
00:56:25,050 --> 00:56:28,900
Let’s take a look at this word.

700
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:34,950
The jaw drops, but just a little bit less
than it would in a stressed syllable.

701
00:56:34,950 --> 00:56:39,580
Then the tongue arches up towards the roof
of the mouth before the tip goes to the roof

702
00:56:39,580 --> 00:56:45,030
of the mouth for the D.

703
00:56:45,030 --> 00:56:52,580
The AI diphthong, stressed: hi, AI

704
00:56:52,580 --> 00:57:01,410
The AI diphthong, unstressed: idea, ai

705
00:57:01,410 --> 00:57:06,844
AI, ai, AI, ai.

706
00:57:07,116 --> 00:57:09,730
Example words.

707
00:57:09,730 --> 00:57:11,261
Repeat with me:

708
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:18,360
Exercise, AI, Exercise

709
00:57:18,632 --> 00:57:25,066
Wine, AI, Wine

710
00:57:26,264 --> 00:57:32,720
Bright, AI, Bright

711
00:57:34,408 --> 00:57:41,310
Guy, AI, Guy

712
00:57:42,780 --> 00:57:49,900
Allies, ai, Allies

713
00:57:50,989 --> 00:57:57,738
Sky, AI, Sky

714
00:57:58,064 --> 00:58:02,719
The OH as in NO diphthong.

715
00:58:02,719 --> 00:58:06,430
Diphthongs are a combination of two sounds.

716
00:58:06,430 --> 00:58:10,470
They have a starting position and an ending
position.

717
00:58:10,470 --> 00:58:16,180
The jaw drops for the beginning position,
tongue shifts back a little bit.

718
00:58:16,180 --> 00:58:21,470
The lips may start relaxed, or may start rounding
right from the beginning.

719
00:58:21,470 --> 00:58:27,330
After dropping the jaw, immediately start
moving into the ending position: the lips

720
00:58:27,330 --> 00:58:30,980
round, and the back part of the tongue stretches
up.

721
00:58:30,980 --> 00:58:35,020
Focus on the movement of the jaw and the lip
rounding.

722
00:58:35,334 --> 00:58:39,490
Let’s see this sound up close and in slow
motion.

723
00:58:39,490 --> 00:58:46,359
Jaw drop for the first position, and rounded
lips for the second.

724
00:58:46,359 --> 00:58:48,720
The word ‘slow’.

725
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:53,940
Notice how the lips are not relaxed in the
first position of this diphthong, with the

726
00:58:53,940 --> 00:58:55,260
jaw drop.

727
00:58:55,260 --> 00:59:00,760
They’re flared, which does not affect the
sound, as they prepare to round for the ending

728
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:02,074
position.

729
00:59:02,074 --> 00:59:04,960
Rounded lips.

730
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:10,802
In a stressed syllable, the OH diphthong curves
up then down.

731
00:59:10,802 --> 00:59:15,140
Slow, oh.

732
00:59:15,140 --> 00:59:22,479
In an unstressed syllable, it’s lower and
flatter in pitch, as well as quieter and quicker,

733
00:59:22,479 --> 00:59:24,460
oh.

734
00:59:24,460 --> 00:59:30,310
The diphthong is unstressed in the word ‘okay’,
oh.

735
00:59:30,746 --> 00:59:34,890
Let’s take a look at the word ‘okay’.

736
00:59:34,890 --> 00:59:41,450
The jaw drops, but not quite as much as it
did on the stressed syllable of ‘slow’.

737
00:59:41,450 --> 00:59:46,020
The lips begin to round for the transition
into the ending position.

738
00:59:46,020 --> 00:59:53,014
The lips round, but not quite as much as for
the stressed OH in ‘slow’.

739
00:59:53,831 --> 01:00:00,660
Here we compare the first position of the
stressed OH on top with the unstressed version

740
01:00:00,660 --> 01:00:01,770
on the bottom.

741
01:00:01,770 --> 01:00:05,710
Less jaw drop for the unstressed version.

742
01:00:05,710 --> 01:00:07,990
And here, the second position.

743
01:00:07,990 --> 01:00:15,020
You can see that for the stressed OH, on top,
the lips round more than they do in the unstressed

744
01:00:15,020 --> 01:00:16,130
version.

745
01:00:16,130 --> 01:00:22,520
Generally, the unstressed version of a vowel
or diphthong is more relaxed and often doesn’t

746
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:29,294
take the full mouth position, in this case,
less jaw drop and less lip rounding.

747
01:00:29,294 --> 01:00:35,640
This is because we don’t take as much time
for unstressed syllables, they’re shorter,

748
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:39,350
so we simplify the mouth movements.

749
01:00:39,350 --> 01:00:47,460
The OH diphthong, stressed: slow, OH

750
01:00:47,460 --> 01:00:53,420
Unstressed: okay, oh

751
01:00:53,420 --> 01:01:00,000
OH, oh, OH, oh.

752
01:01:00,225 --> 01:01:02,720
Example words.

753
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:04,955
Repeat with me:

754
01:01:04,955 --> 01:01:11,399
Alone, OH, Alone

755
01:01:12,597 --> 01:01:18,936
Tomorrow, oh, Tomorrow

756
01:01:20,897 --> 01:01:27,840
Home, OH, Home

757
01:01:29,583 --> 01:01:35,284
Window, oh, Window

758
01:01:37,571 --> 01:01:43,601
Phone, OH, Phone

759
01:01:44,581 --> 01:01:51,367
Social, OH, Social

760
01:01:51,367 --> 01:01:55,668
The OW as in NOW diphthong.

761
01:01:55,668 --> 01:02:02,270
Diphthongs are a combination of two sounds,
so they have a starting position and an ending

762
01:02:02,270 --> 01:02:04,313
position.

763
01:02:04,313 --> 01:02:07,630
To start this sound, drop the jaw.

764
01:02:07,630 --> 01:02:13,080
The first sound is similar to the AA as in
BAT vowel.

765
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:18,420
The tongue is wide and flat, the back stretches
up a little bit.

766
01:02:18,420 --> 01:02:22,660
The tongue tip touches the back of the bottom
front teeth.

767
01:02:22,660 --> 01:02:27,830
The upper lip might lift a little, or it will
be relaxed.

768
01:02:27,830 --> 01:02:34,370
To transition into the second position, the
lips round and the jaw drops less.

769
01:02:34,370 --> 01:02:37,869
The back of the tongue stretches up more.

770
01:02:37,869 --> 01:02:45,600
This second position is considered the same
as the UH as in PUSH vowel.

771
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:51,260
But when it’s a part of a diphthong, the
lips round more than when it occurs as a pure

772
01:02:51,260 --> 01:02:52,380
vowel.

773
01:02:52,380 --> 01:02:57,210
Let’s see this sound up close and in slow
motion.

774
01:02:57,210 --> 01:02:58,380
Jaw drops.

775
01:02:58,380 --> 01:03:01,800
Here, the upper lip pulls a little bit.

776
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:03,640
The tongue lifts in the back.

777
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:09,290
Now the lips come in and round as the jaw
comes up.

778
01:03:09,290 --> 01:03:11,450
The word ‘wound’.

779
01:03:11,450 --> 01:03:17,630
The lips start in a tight circle for the W,
but then open out for the first position of

780
01:03:17,630 --> 01:03:25,380
the diphthong before rounding again for the
second position of the diphthong.

781
01:03:25,380 --> 01:03:31,050
In a stressed syllable, the OW diphthong curves
up then down.

782
01:03:31,050 --> 01:03:34,190
Wound, OW.

783
01:03:34,190 --> 01:03:41,660
In an unstressed syllable, it’s lower and
flatter in pitch, as well as quieter and quicker,

784
01:03:41,660 --> 01:03:44,500
ow, ow.

785
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:50,220
The diphthong is unstressed in the word ‘shutdown’,
ow.

786
01:03:50,492 --> 01:03:53,338
Let’s take a look at this word.

787
01:03:54,591 --> 01:04:01,170
Jaw drops, but notice the top lip is relaxed,
it doesn’t pull up.

788
01:04:01,170 --> 01:04:03,740
Tongue is lifted in the back.

789
01:04:03,740 --> 01:04:08,970
In the ending position, the lips aren’t
quite as rounded as they were in the stressed

790
01:04:08,970 --> 01:04:11,334
version of this diphthong.

791
01:04:11,334 --> 01:04:18,360
Here you see the jaw drop in the first position
of the diphthong, stressed version on top.

792
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:22,490
Notice that the jaw doesn’t drop as much
for the unstressed diphthong.

793
01:04:22,490 --> 01:04:25,780
Here’s the second position.

794
01:04:25,780 --> 01:04:32,190
The lips don’t round as much for the unstressed
diphthong; they’re more relaxed.

795
01:04:32,190 --> 01:04:39,160
Generally, the unstressed version of a vowel
or diphthong is more relaxed and often doesn’t

796
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:46,630
take the full mouth position, in this case,
less jaw drop and less lip rounding.

797
01:04:46,630 --> 01:04:50,640
This is because we don’t take as much time
with unstressed syllables.

798
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:56,099
They’re shorter, so we simplify the mouth
movements.

799
01:04:56,099 --> 01:05:03,187
The OW diphthong, stressed: wound, OW

800
01:05:03,732 --> 01:05:09,634
Unstressed: shutdown, ow

801
01:05:09,961 --> 01:05:17,250
OW, ow, OW, ow.

802
01:05:17,740 --> 01:05:20,090
Example words.

803
01:05:20,090 --> 01:05:21,260
Repeat with me:

804
01:05:22,349 --> 01:05:28,486
About, OW, About

805
01:05:29,194 --> 01:05:35,504
Sound, OW, Sound

806
01:05:36,484 --> 01:05:43,084
House, OW, House

807
01:05:43,955 --> 01:05:49,381
Letdown, ow, Letdown

808
01:05:50,579 --> 01:05:56,455
Blackout, ow, Blackout

809
01:05:58,250 --> 01:06:00,372
Found.

810
01:06:00,372 --> 01:06:04,291
OW, Found

811
01:06:04,890 --> 01:06:09,028
The OY as in TOY diphthong.

812
01:06:09,028 --> 01:06:15,220
Diphthongs are a combination of two sounds,
so they have a starting position and an ending

813
01:06:15,220 --> 01:06:16,554
position.

814
01:06:16,554 --> 01:06:22,460
This diphthong begins with the AW as in LAW
[ɔ] vowel.

815
01:06:22,460 --> 01:06:29,682
As a part of the diphthong, the lips round
more than they do for the pure vowel by itself,

816
01:06:29,682 --> 01:06:32,165
like in the word ‘law’.

817
01:06:33,255 --> 01:06:34,890
Oy.

818
01:06:34,890 --> 01:06:40,330
The tongue is slightly lifted and shifted
a bit back, so the tip of the tongue is not

819
01:06:40,330 --> 01:06:42,180
touching anything.

820
01:06:42,180 --> 01:06:46,859
The ending position is the 'ih' as in 'sit'
vowel.

821
01:06:46,859 --> 01:06:49,859
The lips relax and the tongue comes forward.

822
01:06:49,859 --> 01:06:55,390
The tip lightly touches the back of the bottom
front teeth, and the top, front part of the

823
01:06:55,390 --> 01:06:58,660
tongue arches up towards the roof of the mouth.

824
01:06:58,660 --> 01:07:00,876
This brings the jaw back up.

825
01:07:01,918 --> 01:07:06,420
Let’s look at this sound up close and in
slow motion.

826
01:07:06,420 --> 01:07:10,050
At the beginning of the diphthong, the lips
are rounded.

827
01:07:10,050 --> 01:07:15,000
The space inside the mouth is dark because
the tongue has shifted back.

828
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:21,590
For the second position, the corners of the
lips have relaxed out and the front, top part

829
01:07:21,590 --> 01:07:25,280
of tongue reaches up towards the roof of the
mouth.

830
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:27,470
There is still some jaw drop.

831
01:07:27,470 --> 01:07:29,990
Here’s the word ‘toy’.

832
01:07:29,990 --> 01:07:36,660
Again, lips round for the first sound, and
relax for the second sound as the tongue arches

833
01:07:36,660 --> 01:07:39,869
towards the roof of the mouth in the front.

834
01:07:40,459 --> 01:07:46,314
In a stressed syllable, the OY diphthong curves
up then down.

835
01:07:46,314 --> 01:07:50,370
Toy, OY.

836
01:07:50,370 --> 01:07:58,099
In an unstressed syllable, it’s lower and
flatter in pitch, as well as quieter and quicker,

837
01:07:58,099 --> 01:08:01,070
oy, oy.

838
01:08:01,070 --> 01:08:06,410
The diphthong is unstressed in the word ‘tabloid’,
oy.

839
01:08:06,900 --> 01:08:09,890
Let’s take a look at this word.

840
01:08:09,890 --> 01:08:15,628
The diphthong looks the same: lips rounded
for the beginning position, then relaxing

841
01:08:15,628 --> 01:08:21,042
out for the ending position, before the tongue
tip flips up for the D.

842
01:08:22,209 --> 01:08:29,212
But because the pitch is flatter and the syllable
is quicker, it sounds unstressed.

843
01:08:29,539 --> 01:08:37,388
The OY diphthong, stressed: toy, OY

844
01:08:37,388 --> 01:08:43,333
Unstressed: tabloid, oy

845
01:08:43,878 --> 01:08:51,846
OY, oy, OY, oy.

846
01:08:52,445 --> 01:08:54,820
Example words.

847
01:08:54,820 --> 01:08:56,178
Repeat with me:

848
01:08:57,158 --> 01:09:04,290
Oil, OY, Oil

849
01:09:06,251 --> 01:09:13,274
Coin, OY, Coin

850
01:09:14,636 --> 01:09:20,678

854
01:09:43,960 --> 01:09:48,292
The EW as in FEW diphthong.

855
01:09:48,594 --> 01:09:52,222
Diphthongs are a combination of two sounds.

856
01:09:52,222 --> 01:09:56,790
They have a starting position and an ending
position.

857
01:09:56,790 --> 01:10:01,090
The first sound is the Y consonant.

858
01:10:01,090 --> 01:10:06,910
Diphthongs are normally made up of two vowel
sounds, but in this case, the Y consonant

859
01:10:06,910 --> 01:10:09,050
is acting as a vowel.

860
01:10:09,540 --> 01:10:17,650
For example, in the word ‘music’ the Y
sound goes with the OO vowel to make a diphthong

861
01:10:17,650 --> 01:10:24,000
rather than with the M consonant to make a
consonant cluster, music.

862
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:27,880
To make the Y sound, the jaw drops a little
bit.

863
01:10:27,880 --> 01:10:33,450
The lips may be relaxed, or they may begin
rounding for the ending position.

864
01:10:33,450 --> 01:10:38,330
The tongue tip is down, lightly touching the
back of the bottom front teeth.

865
01:10:38,330 --> 01:10:44,020
The mid/front part of the tongue lifts and
touches the roof of the mouth about here.

866
01:10:44,020 --> 01:10:49,270
It pushes forward against the roof of the
mouth before pulling away.

867
01:10:49,270 --> 01:10:56,460
As we move the tongue on the roof of the mouth,
we close the vocal cords to get this sound:

868
01:10:56,460 --> 01:11:02,750
yy, which we add to the sound.

869
01:11:02,750 --> 01:11:05,739
Yy, yy.

870
01:11:05,739 --> 01:11:09,100
We release it the same time we release the
tongue.

871
01:11:09,100 --> 01:11:17,610
To transition into the next sound, we release
right into the position of OO as in BOO vowel.

872
01:11:17,610 --> 01:11:22,640
The tongue tip doesn’t need to move; it
remains touching the back of the bottom front

873
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:23,650
teeth.

874
01:11:23,650 --> 01:11:28,120
The back part of the tongue lifts towards
the soft palate.

875
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:30,070
The lips round.

876
01:11:30,070 --> 01:11:36,120
Let’s study a word with this sound, ‘use’.

877
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:41,910
Jaw drops just a little bit as the tongue
lifts and presses forward against the roof

878
01:11:41,910 --> 01:11:43,070
of the mouth.

879
01:11:43,070 --> 01:11:49,000
The lips flare in preparation for the rounding
at the end of the diphthong.

880
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:55,440
Tongue releases, lifts in the back, and the
lips round.

881
01:11:55,440 --> 01:12:01,430
In a stressed syllable, the EW diphthong curves
up then down.

882
01:12:01,430 --> 01:12:05,120
Use, ew.

883
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:12,670
In an unstressed syllable, it’s lower and
flatter in pitch, as well as quieter and quicker,

884
01:12:12,670 --> 01:12:15,719
ew, ew.

885
01:12:15,719 --> 01:12:21,190
The diphthong is unstressed in the word ‘interview’,
ew.

886
01:12:22,007 --> 01:12:25,418
Let’s take a look at the word ‘interview’.

887
01:12:26,730 --> 01:12:32,210
A little bit of lip rounding in the first
position of the diphthong.

888
01:12:32,210 --> 01:12:36,840
But in the ending position, the lip rounding
is subtle.

889
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:39,320
Not like in a stressed EW diphthong.

890
01:12:39,320 --> 01:12:45,480
Let’s compare the ending position of the
stressed EW diphthong, above, with the unstressed

891
01:12:45,480 --> 01:12:47,520
diphthong, below.

892
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:51,570
In the stressed version, the lips round much
more.

893
01:12:52,387 --> 01:12:58,290
Generally, the unstressed version of a vowel
or diphthong is more relaxed and doesn’t

894
01:12:58,290 --> 01:13:03,278
take the full mouth position, in this case,
less lip rounding.

895
01:13:03,278 --> 01:13:09,650
This is because we don’t take as much time
for unstressed syllables, they’re shorter,

896
01:13:09,650 --> 01:13:12,598
so we simplify the mouth movements.

897
01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:21,580
EW stressed: use, EW

898
01:13:21,580 --> 01:13:27,740
Unstressed: interview, ew

899
01:13:27,740 --> 01:13:34,544
EW, ew, EW, ew.

900
01:13:35,089 --> 01:13:37,210
Example words.

901
01:13:37,210 --> 01:13:38,980
Repeat with me:

902
01:13:38,980 --> 01:13:44,647
Music, EW, Music

903
01:13:45,573 --> 01:13:52,399
Continue, ew, Continue

904
01:13:53,543 --> 01:14:00,000
Review, EW, Review

905
01:14:01,253 --> 01:14:07,579
Unite, ew, Unite

906
01:14:08,886 --> 01:14:15,406
Union, EW, Union

907
01:14:16,822 --> 01:14:23,343
Future, EW, Future

908
01:14:23,343 --> 01:14:30,090
In this video, we’re going to do side by
side comparisons of vowel and diphthong sounds

909
01:14:30,090 --> 01:14:31,940
that are similar.

910
01:14:31,940 --> 01:14:38,066
Seeing how similar sounds are different should
help you solidify the individual sounds.

911
01:14:38,066 --> 01:14:40,283
Let’s get started.

912
01:14:45,584 --> 01:14:52,300
Notice how the lips are completely relaxed
for AH, but the corners pull back and up for

913
01:14:52,300 --> 01:14:54,407
AA.

914
01:14:58,543 --> 01:15:15,334
Ah, aa, ah, aa.

915
01:15:21,395 --> 01:15:25,404
Notice how there’s more jaw drop for ah.

916
01:15:25,404 --> 01:15:29,544
Press your tongue down in the back for this
vowel.

917
01:15:34,174 --> 01:15:37,778
ah

918
01:15:38,704 --> 01:15:41,412
uuh

919
01:15:42,011 --> 01:15:45,000
Ah

920
01:15:46,353 --> 01:15:49,823
uh

921
01:15:55,314 --> 01:16:02,320
Notice how the corners of the lips pull back
and up just a bit for the AA vowel.

922
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:05,260
This is the word ‘sat’.

923
01:16:05,260 --> 01:16:08,640
The lips are more relaxed for EH.

924
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:11,060
This is the word ‘said’.

925
01:16:15,090 --> 01:16:19,008
Sat

926
01:16:19,825 --> 01:16:22,612
said

927
01:16:23,865 --> 01:16:26,519
sat

928
01:16:28,370 --> 01:16:30,969
said

929
01:16:37,251 --> 01:16:45,326
Notice how the lips are totally relaxed for
‘ah’, but flared a bit for ‘aw’.

930
01:16:49,792 --> 01:16:53,244
ah

931
01:16:54,006 --> 01:16:57,313
aw

932
01:16:58,294 --> 01:17:01,002
ah

933
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:05,616
aw

934
01:17:11,668 --> 01:17:14,207
IH has more jaw drop.

935
01:17:14,207 --> 01:17:20,131
The tongue arches closer to the roof of the
mouth in EE.

936
01:17:25,359 --> 01:17:28,309
ih

937
01:17:28,581 --> 01:17:32,470
ee

938
01:17:33,723 --> 01:17:36,540
ih

939
01:17:37,248 --> 01:17:41,154
ee

940
01:17:47,668 --> 01:17:50,598
EH has more jaw drop.

941
01:17:50,598 --> 01:17:53,640
This is the word ‘said’.

942
01:17:53,640 --> 01:18:00,300
In IH, the front part of the tongue arches
closer to the roof of the mouth.

943
01:18:00,300 --> 01:18:03,239
This is the word ‘fix’.

944
01:18:08,794 --> 01:18:12,344
Fix

945
01:18:12,562 --> 01:18:16,058
Said

946
01:18:17,746 --> 01:18:20,969
Fix

947
01:18:21,731 --> 01:18:25,584
Said.

948
01:18:31,590 --> 01:18:33,710
The jaw drops less for EE.

949
01:18:35,344 --> 01:18:39,222
Here, EE is in the word ‘please’.

950
01:18:39,549 --> 01:18:44,710
Notice how much the jaw drops for the first
sound of AY.

951
01:18:44,710 --> 01:18:47,377
This is the word ‘pay’.

952
01:18:52,660 --> 01:18:56,459
pay

953
01:18:57,450 --> 01:19:00,459
please

954
01:19:01,628 --> 01:19:05,098
pay

955
01:19:06,569 --> 01:19:09,418
please

956
01:19:15,367 --> 01:19:20,900
The jaw drops more for the first sound of
the diphthong in the word ‘pay’.

957
01:19:20,900 --> 01:19:23,630
But the tongue is forward for both sounds.

958
01:19:23,957 --> 01:19:28,690
Here, the IH vowel is in the word ‘fix’.

959
01:19:29,670 --> 01:19:34,711
The second half of the diphthong is the same
sound as the IH vowel.

960
01:19:35,092 --> 01:19:38,837
But here the jaw drops a little less.

961
01:19:44,610 --> 01:19:47,835
pay

962
01:19:49,142 --> 01:19:52,395
fix

963
01:19:54,137 --> 01:19:57,335
pay

964
01:19:59,024 --> 01:20:02,543
fix

965
01:20:08,436 --> 01:20:15,640
The mouth position for the EH vowel in ‘said’
looks identical to the first half of the diphthong

966
01:20:15,640 --> 01:20:17,160
in ‘pay’.

967
01:20:17,160 --> 01:20:22,890
But look at the jaw for the second position
of the AY diphthong.

968
01:20:22,890 --> 01:20:24,277
Less jaw drop.

969
01:20:31,684 --> 01:20:35,668
pay

970
01:20:36,267 --> 01:20:38,866
said

971
01:20:41,099 --> 01:20:44,025
pay

972
01:20:45,664 --> 01:20:48,427
said

973
01:20:54,780 --> 01:21:01,160
Notice how the lips and mouth are totally
relaxed for the UH as in BUTTER vowel, but

974
01:21:01,160 --> 01:21:06,266
for the UR vowel, the lips flare and the tongue
is pulled back.

975
01:21:12,039 --> 01:21:15,447
uh

976
01:21:16,427 --> 01:21:19,189
ur

977
01:21:20,333 --> 01:21:23,422
uh

978
01:21:24,185 --> 01:21:27,668
ur

979
01:21:32,983 --> 01:21:40,110
There’s more jaw drop for the UH as in BUTTER
sound, which is usually stressed, than for

980
01:21:40,110 --> 01:21:43,700
the schwa, which is always unstressed.

981
01:21:43,700 --> 01:21:47,102
Here, it looks like there is no jaw drop.

982
01:21:51,676 --> 01:21:55,109
Uh, 

983
01:21:55,109 --> 01:21:57,719
uh

984
01:21:58,318 --> 01:22:01,353
Uh

985
01:22:01,680 --> 01:22:03,587
uh

986
01:22:09,759 --> 01:22:13,654
The 
lips round much more for the OO vowel.

987
01:22:13,654 --> 01:22:18,445
Flare them for the UH as in PUSH vowel.

988
01:22:21,930 --> 01:22:25,810
UH

989
01:22:26,300 --> 01:22:29,073
oo

990
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:33,089
UH

991
01:22:33,360 --> 01:22:36,177
oo

992
01:22:42,420 --> 01:22:50,150
The lips flare a bit for the UH as in PUSH
vowel, but are totally relaxed for the UH

993
01:22:50,150 --> 01:22:52,793
as in BUTTER vowel.

994
01:22:56,420 --> 01:23:11,265
Uh

995
01:23:16,874 --> 01:23:22,400
Remember to start your lips in a relaxed position
for OO.

996
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:28,350
For the OH diphthong the jaw drops a lot for
the beginning sound.

997
01:23:28,350 --> 01:23:34,690
Then the lips make a tight circle for OO,
and round, but not as much, for the second

998
01:23:34,690 --> 01:23:36,432
sound of OH.

999
01:23:47,269 --> 01:23:50,543
oo

1000
01:23:51,088 --> 01:23:53,524
oh

1001
01:23:54,776 --> 01:23:57,430
oo

1002
01:23:58,410 --> 01:24:01,009
oh

1003
01:24:07,460 --> 01:24:14,270
The beginning position of OH looks a lot like
the AH vowel, but the tongue pushes down in

1004
01:24:14,270 --> 01:24:17,150
the back for the AH vowel.

1005
01:24:17,150 --> 01:24:23,690
The ending position of the OH diphthong has
lip rounding, but the lips are always relaxed

1006
01:24:23,690 --> 01:24:25,959
for the AH vowel.

1007
01:24:31,405 --> 01:24:34,166
OH

1008
01:24:35,037 --> 01:24:37,799
AH

1009
01:24:38,998 --> 01:24:41,652
OH

1010
01:24:42,686 --> 01:24:45,557
AH

1011
01:24:51,835 --> 01:24:58,880
Notice how the corners of the lips pull back
for the first sound of the OW diphthong, but

1012
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:02,630
the lips flare for the AW vowel.

1013
01:25:02,630 --> 01:25:09,910
The jaw drops much less and the lips flare
a little for the second half of the OW diphthong.

1014
01:25:09,910 --> 01:25:14,455
The mouth position doesn’t change for the
AW vowel.

1015
01:25:29,105 --> 01:25:32,292
OW

1016
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,980
AW

1017
01:25:37,287 --> 01:25:39,832
OW

1018
01:25:40,921 --> 01:25:43,847
AW 

1019
01:25:45,300 --> 01:25:51,670
Now we’ll see and say all those sounds and
words again, mixed up in a different order.

1020
01:25:52,650 --> 01:25:55,595
Say them with me, in slow motion.

1021
01:25:57,501 --> 01:26:00,086
Aa

1022
01:26:02,086 --> 01:26:04,522
ah

1023
01:26:06,101 --> 01:26:09,680
aw

1024
01:26:10,171 --> 01:26:13,097
ah

1025
01:26:13,914 --> 01:26:17,330
aa

1026
01:26:18,528 --> 01:26:21,781
sat

1027
01:26:22,979 --> 01:26:25,741
said 

1028
01:26:26,543 --> 01:26:29,741
aa

1029
01:26:31,226 --> 01:26:33,934
ah

1030
01:26:35,934 --> 01:26:38,533

I'm so glad you’ve taken the time to watch
this video.

01:28:50,420 --> 01:28:54,920
Really understanding the mouth positions for
the sounds of American English can help you

1065
01:28:54,920 --> 01:28:57,490
gain greater clarity in your spoken English.

1066
01:28:57,490 --> 01:29:03,415
We’ll have another video coming out in few
weeks, a compilation of all the consonant sounds.

1067
01:29:03,415 --> 01:29:08,190
For now, keep your learning going with this video

English.
