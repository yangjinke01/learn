00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:02,939
In this American English pronunciation

2
00:00:02,939 --> 00:00:05,529
video, we’re going to learn how to pronounce

3
00:00:05,529 --> 00:00:09,420
the UH as in PUSH vowel.

4
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:19,240
To make this sound, the corners of the lips

5
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:22,230
come in a little so the lips flare away

6
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:26,779
from the face, UH.

7
00:00:26,779 --> 00:00:29,529
The back of the tongue lifts towards the back

8
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:32,759
of the roof of the mouth. The front of the

9
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:35,820
tongue remains down, but it might be pulled

10
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,770
slightly back, so it’s not quite touching the

11
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:41,920
back of the bottom front teeth.

12
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,200
Let’s look at this sound up close and in

13
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:46,860
slow motion.

14
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:49,399
The lips flare and the tongue inside the

15
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:51,969
mouth is a little darker than on other

16
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:56,160
vowels because the tongue is pulled back.

17
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,300
Here’s the word ‘took’. The corners of the

18
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:02,329
mouth come in to flare the lips. The back

19
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:04,949
of the tongue lifts, and the front pulls

20
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:08,430
back a little.

21
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:11,439
In a stressed syllable, the vowel curves up

22
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:18,540
then down. Took, uh. In an unstressed

23
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:21,640
syllable, it’s lower and flatter in pitch,

24
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:25,240
as well as quieter and quicker. The vowel

25
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:31,000
is unstressed in the word ‘good-bye’, uh, uh.

26
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,560
Let’s look at this word up close

27
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,060
and in slow motion.

28
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:38,500
Again, the lips flare and the tongue lifts in the

29
00:01:38,509 --> 00:01:42,740
back, pulling back the front of the tongue.

30
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:45,060
Let’s compare the stressed version on

31
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:47,820
top with the unstressed version on

32
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:51,299
the bottom. Notice the lips flare a little

33
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:54,360
less for the unstressed vowel, hiding the

34
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,520
bottom teeth.

35
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,600
Generally, the unstressed version of a vowel

36
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,189
or diphthong is more relaxed and doesn’t

37
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:05,810
take the full mouth position, in this case,

38
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:09,310
a little less lip flare, and possibly less jaw

39
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:12,750
drop. This is because unstressed syllables

40
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,739
are shorter, so we don’t take the time to

41
00:02:15,739 --> 00:02:18,599
make the full mouth position.

42
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:26,180
The stressed UH: took, UH

43
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:32,540
Unstressed: good-bye, uh

44
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:40,140
UH, uh. UH, uh.

45
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:44,020
Example words. Repeat with me:
