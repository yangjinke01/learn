1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:06,640
In this American English pronunciation video, 
we're going to learn how to make the W sound.

2
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:20,040
To make this sound, ww--, the 
lips form a tight circle. Ww--

3
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:25,680
The back part of the tongue 
stretches up towards the soft palate.

4
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,480
While the front part of the tongue lightly 
touches the back of the bottom front teeth.

5
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:40,080
To give this sound the right quality, you have to 
close the vocal cords to get this sound: ww-- ww--

6
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:44,840
Ww-- which we add to the sound ww--

7
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:51,720
You release the vocal cords as you release 
the lips, coming out of the W sound. Ww--

8
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,800
Let's look at the sound up 
close and in slow motion.

9
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,600
With the tight circle for the lips, 
you can't see the tongue at all.

10
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,360
But it lifts in the back. The word 'why'.

11
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,840
A tight circle for the lips.

12
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,120
The word 'west'.

13
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,400
Again, a tight circle for the lips.

14
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,400
The word 'unwind'. Here, the W 
is in the middle of the word.

15
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:26,800
We still take the time to bring 
the lips into a tight circle.

16
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,280
This sound is most common 
at the beginning of words.

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,840
It doesn't occur at the end of any 
words, though the letter W does.

18
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,400
The W consonant.

19
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,180
Why

20
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,080
West

21
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,080
Unwind

22
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,000
Example words. Repeat with me.

23
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:58,240
Water. Ww-- Water.

24
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:08,080
Welcome. Ww-- Welcome.

25
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,160
Rework. Ww-- Rework.

26
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:22,240
Away. Ww-- Away.

27
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:26,240
Between. Ww-- Between.

28
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,600
Will. Ww-- Will.
