In this American English pronunciation video,

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:07,520
we're going to go over how 
to pronounce the Y consonant.

3
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,240
To make the Y sound, the jaw drops a little bit.

4
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:21,680
Yy--

5
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:27,680
The lips may be relaxed, or they may begin 
to take the position of the next sound.

6
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,040
The tongue tip is down, lightly touching 
the back of the bottom front teeth.

7
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,760
The middle part of the tongue lifts 
and touches the roof of the mouth.

8
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:42,000
It pushes forward against the roof 
of the mouth before pulling away.

9
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,200
As we push the tongue forward 
on the roof of the mouth,

10
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:53,520
we close the vocal cords to 
get this sound. Yy-- yy--

11
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:59,200
which we add to the sound yyi-- yyi--

12
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,320
We release them the same 
time we release the tongue.

13
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,480
Relaxed jaw drop and the lips are relaxed.

14
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:11,280

middle of the tongue presses forward  

15
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,880

to round for the next sound.
