00:00:00,229 --> 00:00:05,509
A friend of mine in a rock band here in New
York recently asked me and another friend

2
00:00:05,509 --> 00:00:12,459
to show up at his concert wearing a horse
mask. Needless to say, this generated quite

3
00:00:12,459 --> 00:00:20,480
a bit of interest. And this got us all thinking
about idioms involving a horse. In this American

4
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:25,080
English pronunciation video, we'll go over
some of those idioms.

5
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:38,559
Would you believe we came up with almost 20
phrases and idioms that use the word horse,

6
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:42,320
or somehow reference horses. And, I'm sure
there are more.

7
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,620
>> Get off your high horse.
>> Get off your high horse. That's a perfect

8
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:47,850
one.
>> Stop horsing around

9
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:52,679
>> These are, you have so many idioms!
>> Yeah, I'm cheating.

10
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:58,219
Get off your high horse. To be on a 'high
horse' is to have an attitude of arrogance,

11
00:00:58,219 --> 00:01:04,100
of self-righteousness. 'Get off your high
horse' means, stop being so arrogant. You

12
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:09,720
have a couple options with the T in 'get'.
You can either make it a flap T, connecting

13
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:15,780
it to the word 'off', get off, get off. Or,
if you're really emphasizing and going to

14
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:24,110
make a pause, you can make it a stop T. Get
off. Get off your high horse.

15
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:31,920
Stop horsing around. Horsing around is rough
of rowdy play, usually in good fun. My mom

16
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,250
often accused my brother and I of horsing
around.

17
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:42,530
>> Horse idioms. We have: don't look a gift
horse in the mouth...

18
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:45,579
>> ...you can lead a horse to water, but you
can't make it drink,

19
00:01:45,579 --> 00:01:46,990
>> ...hoofing it.

20
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:53,000
Don't look a gift horse in the mouth. This
means, don't be ungrateful or suspicious when

21
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,390
someone gives you something. A friend said
this to me recently when I was talking about

22
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:03,030
an offer that I got from someone to help me
with my business. And I was a little suspicious.

23
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:07,760
He said, "You know, Rachel, don't look a gift
horse in the mouth."

24
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:13,299
You can lead a horse to water, but you can't
make it drink. This basically means, you can't

25
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:20,030
make people do what they don't want to do.
Let's talk a little bit about the pronunciation.

26
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:27,219
You can lead a horse. So the main verb here
is the word 'lead'. That means 'can' is a

27
00:02:27,219 --> 00:02:34,510
helping verb. So we don't want to say 'can'.
We instead want to reduce that word to 'kn',

28
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:42,269
'kn'. You can lead. You can lead a horse to
water. But you can't make it drink. You might

29
00:02:42,269 --> 00:02:49,590
hear a CH sound happening between 'but' and
'you', but you, but you. This can happen when

30
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:56,989
the T is followed by the Y consonant, but
you, but you. But you can't make it drink.

31
00:02:56,989 --> 00:03:00,579
You can lead a horse to water, but you can't
make it drink.

32
00:03:00,579 --> 00:03:07,620
Hoofing it means to be moving really fast,
to be running somewhere. For example, I hoofed

33
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:14,239
it to work because I overslept. Note that
the double-O here is pronounced as the UH

34
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:19,459
vowel, just like cook, book, and Brooklyn.

35
00:03:19,459 --> 00:03:24,009
>> Straight from the horse's mouth.
>> Making hay.

36
00:03:24,009 --> 00:03:25,620
>> A charlie horse.

37
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:31,849
Straight from the horse's mouth means that
you've something from the most authoritative

38
00:03:31,849 --> 00:03:39,269
or dependable source. For example: >> Did
you hear Jane is quitting her job? >> No way.

39
00:03:39,269 --> 00:03:45,010
Where did you hear that? >> From Jane herself.
Straight from the horse's mouth.

40
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:53,139
Making hay, or, making hay while the sun shines.
This is to make the most of current opportunities.

41
00:03:53,139 --> 00:04:00,049
If you put doing something off, you may loose
the opportunity to do it. For example, let's

42
00:04:00,049 --> 00:04:04,219
make hay and go for a run before it starts
raining again.

43
00:04:04,219 --> 00:04:11,159
A charlie horse. This phrase is used for muscle
cramps in the legs. You might hear this phrase

44
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:12,899
as you watch the Olympics this summer.

45
00:04:12,899 --> 00:04:17,319
>> I could eat a horse.
>> I'm so hungry I could eat a horse. That's true.

46
00:04:17,319 --> 00:04:21,660
>> Did we say don't beat a dead horse? Don't
beat a dead horse.

47
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:27,630
I could eat a horse. Well, this means, of
course, that you're very very hungry. Notice

48
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:34,870
the T at the end of the word 'eat' links to
the next word, a, a schwa sound, so it's a

49
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:43,410
flap T or a light D sound. Eat a, eat a, eat
a. I could eat a horse. >> Rachel, are you

50
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:49,080
hungry? >> Yeah, I skipped lunch, so I could
eat a horse.

51
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:56,290
Don't beat a dead horse. You might say this
to someone who can't let a situation go. If

52
00:04:56,290 --> 00:05:01,350
you think someone needs to accept things as
they are, and they just keep talking about

53
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:07,410
'what if?', 'what if?', then you might say:
Look, don't beat a dead horse. It's done.

54
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:15,350
>> Don't put the cart before the horse.
>> That's a horse of a different color.

55
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:21,750
Don't put the cart before the horse. This
means be patient and do things the right way,

56
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:27,720
in the right order. Sometimes it's very tempting
to do things out of order and skip ahead.

57
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:33,780
But it doesn't always get the best results.
Someone might say to you: do it right, don't

58
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:36,300
put the cart before the horse.

59
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:41,940
A horse of a different color. That is when
you bring something up that is unlike that

60
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:48,730
which you are already talking about. For example,
to me, writing and spelling are easy. But

61
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:54,240
math, that's a horse of a different color.
Meaning, to me, math is very hard.

62
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:54,370
>> Oh, there are so many idioms with 'horse'!
>> Hold your horses!

63
00:05:54,370 --> 00:06:02,280
>> Hold your horses!
>> That's a great one.

64
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:08,780
Hold your horses. That means hold on, be patient,
stop what you've just started. It's among

65
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:16,390
the most common of these horse idioms. Notice
I'm reducing the word 'your' to 'yer', 'yer'.

66
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:18,210
Hold your horses.

67
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:24,100
>> This is a one-horse town. Put a horse out
to pasture.

68
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:32,130
A one-horse town is a small, maybe insignificant
town. For example, he's very overwhelmed by

69
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:34,830
the city, he comes from a one-horse town.

70
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:40,490
To put a horse out to pasture. This is when
a racing horse is retired, but it can also

71
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:46,380
be used with people, when someone is forced
to retire. For example, Larry is past retirement

72
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:49,979
age. I think it's time to put him out to pasture.

73
00:06:49,979 --> 00:06:54,810
>> Wild horses couldn't drag him away.
>> Oh that's a good one. I use that sometimes.

74
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:57,180
My friend used that once recently.

75
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:02,750
Wild horses couldn't drag him away. This is
said when someone is very engrossed in or

76
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:09,150
committed to something. Nothing can persuade
him or her to leave or stop doing that thing.

77
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:15,870
For example, >> Are you watching the Mad Men
Finale tonight? >> Yes, wild horses couldn't

78
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:16,950
drag me away.

79
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:19,330
>> A dark horse candidate, for example.

80
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:26,030
A dark horse is someone who is more or less
unknown who emerges to a place of prominence

81
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:32,030
or importance, usually in a competition. This
is used quite a bit to describe a candidate

82
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:33,150
in politics.

83
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:39,550
After doing our idiom research, we went out
to dinner, and then made our way home. Although,

84
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:45,180
I can't really recommend riding a bike in
the horse mask, because essentially, I could

85
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:47,920
not see a thing out of it.

86
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:57,870
That's it. Thanks so much
for using Rachel's English.
