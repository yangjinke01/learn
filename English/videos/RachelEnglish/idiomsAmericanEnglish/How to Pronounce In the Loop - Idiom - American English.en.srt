In this American English Pronunciation video,
we're going to go over the idiom 'in the loop.'

2
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:18,570
Have you ever heard anyone say "keep me in
the loop", or, "I want to stay in the loop"?

3
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:23,829
This idiom means to be informed or connected.
For example, if you're working on a project

4
00:00:23,829 --> 00:00:28,249
at work, and you've just been talking about
it. To let your coworkers know that you're

5
00:00:28,249 --> 00:00:34,050
interested in staying involved or informed,
you can say, "Great, keep me in the loop."

6
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:40,220
So, keep me in the loop, or stay in the loop:
it's the verb and the word 'loop', a noun,

7
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:46,360
that are stressed. The unstressed words
will be less loud, very quick, and lower in

8
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:53,360
pitch: in the, in the, in the. A tip to
get these two function words connected is

9
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:59,650
to sort of make the N and TH at the same time.
My tongue tip can be just peeking out of the

10
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:05,990
teeth for the TH while this part of the tongue,
the front part, is actually up touching here,

11
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:12,990
where the N is made. So I don't have to
move my tongue between those two sounds.

12
00:01:14,359 --> 00:01:18,929
That will help me say these two function words
very quickly. You may notice there's not

13
00:01:18,929 --> 00:01:25,069
really a strong TH sound, in the, in the.
Don't worry about that, just make sure your

14
00:01:25,069 --> 00:01:30,979
tongue tip is between the teeth. The tongue
pulls back to make the quick schwa sound in

15
00:01:30,979 --> 00:01:36,049
'the', in the, in the, and then the tip of
the tongue goes back to the roof of the mouth

16
00:01:36,049 --> 00:01:42,689
for the Light L of 'loop'. In the lll-.
It's the tip that's up at the roof of the

17
00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:50,299
mouth, so the tongue will bend this way, ll.
The OO as in BOO vowel is next, so you must

18
00:01:50,299 --> 00:01:58,609
round your lips, and finally the P consonant
where the lips come together and part, releasing

19
00:01:58,609 --> 00:02:07,469
a light burst of air. Loop, since it's stressed,
it will have the up-down curve in the voice,

20
00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:17,640
loop, and be longer than 'in the'. In the
loop, in the loop. Keep me in the loop.

21
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:23,280
Practice your English: make up a phrase
with the idiom "In the Loop" and record yourself.

22
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:28,819
Post it as a video response to this video
on YouTube. I can't wait to watch!

23
00:02:28,819 --> 00:02:32,119
That's it, and thanks so much for using
Rachel's English.
