00:00:00,659 --> 00:00:05,759
In this American English pronunciation video,
we're going to go over a controversial new

2
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:10,259
Kmart commercial that bases its joke on American
English pronunciation.

3
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:22,990
First, if you want to check out the commercial,
click here, or follow the link in the description.

4
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:29,160
In the commercial, Kmart takes advantage of
our use of Stop consonants in American English.

5
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:35,969
They use the word 'ship' to sound like the
word 'shit' in the idiom 'to shit your pants'.

6
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:40,059
Let's take a look at why these two words sound
the same.

7
00:00:40,059 --> 00:00:45,559
The only difference in pronunciation is the
final sound. Both of these sounds are stop

8
00:00:45,559 --> 00:00:53,199
consonants. Stop consonants have two parts.
A stop of air, and a release of air. We often

9
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:59,239
leave out the release of air, especially when
the next word begins with a consonant. So,

10
00:00:59,239 --> 00:01:05,830
instead of saying 'ship my', where the lips
open and release the air before the next sound,

11
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:13,860
we'll say 'ship my', without releasing the
air before the M. Ship my, ship my. The same

12
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:20,270
is true of the word 'shit', we don't usually
say 'shit my', releasing the air of the T

13
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:26,420
before the next consonant sound. We usually
say 'shit my', where we hold the air and go

14
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:34,180
right into the next sound, in this case, the
M, without the release. Shit my, shit my.

15
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:41,280
When the release is left out, these two phrases
sound almost exactly the same. Ship my pants,

16
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,390
shit my pants. Kmart wants you to know you
can ship any item they don't have in the store

17
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:51,800
for free, and to make sure you remember, they're
making it sound a lot like the idiom to 'shit

18
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,680
your pants'.

19
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:59,520
What does this idiom mean? First I want to
point out that 'shit' is a cuss word, a dirty

20
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,550
word, as you probably already know. You want
to use this idiom only among friends, in a

21
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:09,490
casual setting, when you feel confident they
won't be offended. It's a colorful way to

22
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:14,450
express that you're worried about something.
For example: I'm shitting my pants over the

23
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:20,610
test on Friday. Or, I'm scared to fly. Don't
shit your pants, you'll be fine.

24
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:27,810
'Shit' begins with the SH sound, sh, where
the teeth are together, the lips flare, and

25
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:35,250
the front part of the tongue is very close
to the roof of the mouth. Then we have the

26
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:43,330
IH as in SIT vowel, with a little jaw drop,
then the stop T, where we cut off the airflow,

27
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:53,480
shit, shit, mm, the M consonant, lips come
together for that, shit mm-mmy. The AI as

28
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:59,510
in BUY diphthong. You do need some jaw drop
for the first half of that diphthong. Shit

29
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:06,850
my. Let's take a moment here to talk about
stress in this phrase: SHIT and PANTS are

30
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:14,240
the two content words, and MY is a function
word. So it will be unstressed. The  stress pattern

31
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:23,770
is DA-da-DA. Long-short-long. DA-da-DA. Shit
my pants. So 'my' needs to be quick, and lower

32
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:31,370
in pitch than the other two words: my, my,
my, shit my. Then we have 'pants': lips come

33
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:38,970
together for the P. Then the AA vowel is followed
by the N consonant. When the AA vowel is followed

34
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:46,110
by a nasal consonant, we have an 'uh' sound
between. Paa-uh-nts. Check out the video I

35
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:52,640
made that explains that concept if you haven't
already. Then we have the N consonant, TS

36
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:57,130
sound. Normally the front part of the tongue
will go to the roof of the mouth for the N

37
00:03:57,130 --> 00:04:03,060
and T sounds, like this. But since they are
followed by the S here, you can take a short

38
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:10,140
cut, and use not the tip but the top part
of the tongue just behind the tip, here. That

39
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:15,120
way your tip can be free to make the SS sound,
where it presses behind the bottom front teeth

40
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:21,570
with the lips closed. To make the S, pull
the tongue away from the roof of the mouth.

41
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:29,130
NTS, NTS. Pants. pants. Shit my pants.

42
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:32,520
I hope you've enjoyed learning this expressive
idiom.

43
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:37,960
Practice your English --- try it out yourself.
Make a video using this idiom and post it

44
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:44,060
as a video response to this video on YouTube.
I'm very interested to see what you come up with.

45
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:48,060
That's it, and thanks so much 
for using Rachel's English.
