00:00:00,348 --> 00:00:06,126
Hey guys. Welcome to the new Rachel's English
mini series, Interview a Broadcaster!

2
00:00:06,127 --> 00:00:19,898
 

3
00:00:19,899 --> 00:00:22,462
Hi guys.  I'm here with Natalie Morales.

4
00:00:22,463 --> 00:00:24,768
Natalie, could you tell me a
little bit about what you do?

5
00:00:24,769 --> 00:00:28,505
>> Sure. I'm a news anchor on the TODAY show,
which is the morning show here in the United,

6
00:00:28,506 --> 00:00:31,372
>> Yeah. >> well, throughout the world
actually. >> Uh-huh. >> You see us everywhere.

7
00:00:31,373 --> 00:00:33,551
>> That's right. Well, I
don't know if you know,

8
00:00:33,552 --> 00:00:37,583
but the standard American accent is
also called Broadcaster English.

9
00:00:37,584 --> 00:00:42,850
>> I did not know that. >> Yeah! So people
all over are looking at people like you,

10
00:00:42,851 --> 00:00:46,326
people who deliver the news in
America, as a standard, as an example

11
00:00:46,327 --> 00:00:49,399
for an American accent. I'm
wondering, where did you grow up, and

12
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:54,123
did you have to change anything about your
accent as you started to go into this field?

13
00:00:54,124 --> 00:00:56,893
>> I actually grew up all
over the world as well.

14
00:00:56,894 --> 00:01:01,836
>> Okay. >> I'm an Air Force brat. I was born
in Taiwan, I lived in Panama, Brazil, Spain...

15
00:01:01,837 --> 00:01:06,122
>> Wow. >> Um, Delaware. My mother >> Okay.
>> is Brazilian, my father Puerto Rican,

16
00:01:06,123 --> 00:01:10,235
so I grew up  >> Okay.  >> speaking a lot of
languages, actually. >> Wow! That is great.

17
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:16,677
>> So, broadcaster English. I suppose it
comes just with training, but um, in my case,

18
00:01:16,678 --> 00:01:21,494
being a broadcaster, but, um, I
think really, I'm, I was fortunate.

19
00:01:21,495 --> 00:01:24,892
I didn't really have an accent because I did
grow up in so many different places. >> Right.

20
00:01:24,893 --> 00:01:29,035
right. That's awesome. >> Yeah.
>> Well, I have a lot of Brazilian fans,

21
00:01:29,036 --> 00:01:33,566
so I'm excited to hear that. >> Oh yeah?
Bom dia! Tudo bem? Oi Brasil!

22
00:01:33,567 --> 00:01:35,170
>> They will love that.
>> Good.

23
00:01:35,171 --> 00:01:39,985
>> So, now, how do you prepare a transcript
to read on camera. Do you have any tips or

24
00:01:39,986 --> 00:01:43,413
tricks, or, how long do you spend
working on something to prepare it?

25
00:01:43,414 --> 00:01:46,697
>> Well, I mean, I think it depends on the
story. If I'm working on a story,

26
00:01:46,698 --> 00:01:52,367
and you know it involves, a lot of producing,
then that could take me a couple days even.

27
00:01:52,368 --> 00:01:56,578
You know, it involves doing interviews,
and other research that I may need.

28
00:01:56,579 --> 00:01:59,604
Uh, but for the most part, in the morning,
preparing for the newscast, I mean, >> Uh-huh.

29
00:01:59,605 --> 00:02:02,730
obviously, I gotta be ready by the
time the show goes on at  >> Right.

30
00:02:02,731 --> 00:02:04,325
7 in the morning, so.  >> Right.

31
00:02:04,326 --> 00:02:12,912
Gotta, I gotta be ready. Did you hear that
reduction? She reduced "I have got to" to

32
00:02:12,913 --> 00:02:20,482
"I gotta". It's common, when we reduce this
phrase, to contract 'got to' to 'gotta'.

33
00:02:20,483 --> 00:02:25,149
But also to drop 'have' altogether.
Listen again.

34
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:29,298
I gotta be ready [3x] by the time
the show goes on at  >> Right.

35
00:02:29,299 --> 00:02:30,869
7 in the morning, so.  >> Right.

36
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:35,454
>> Um, you know, I review all the
news casts, I make all the changes.

37
00:02:35,455 --> 00:02:38,427
So, you know, I spend a good part
of my morning making sure. >> Okay.

38
00:02:38,428 --> 00:02:41,382
And, and, do you read the stuff
out loud as you're practicing?

39
00:02:41,383 --> 00:02:44,619
Or is it more fact checking? >> It's more
fact checking >> Okay. >> for me, yeah.

40
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:47,508
>> So for you, you're just, you
hit the ground running. >> I wing it.

41
00:02:47,509 --> 00:02:49,140
>> Wow!
>> Yeah, I hit the ground running.

42
00:02:49,141 --> 00:02:56,716
Two idioms here. Hit the ground running, and
wing it. Hit the ground running. This means

43
00:02:56,717 --> 00:03:02,388
to start something and proceed quickly,
without too much planning or preparation.

44
00:03:02,389 --> 00:03:09,731
The syllables 'hit' and 'run' will be
the most stressed. DA-da-da-DA-da.

45
00:03:09,732 --> 00:03:16,233
Hit the ground running. The T at the end
of 'hit' is a Stop T because the next word

46
00:03:16,234 --> 00:03:21,185
begins with a consonant.  Hit the, hit the.

47
00:03:21,186 --> 00:03:27,956
To 'wing it' means to improvise. No planning
at all. This should feel like one idea,

48
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:35,598
and not two separate words. It can feel like
the ending consonant NG begins the word 'it',

49
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:44,110
wing it. In this case, that ending T was at
the end of a sentence, so it was a Stop T.

50
00:03:44,111 --> 00:03:47,291
Wing it, wing it.

51
00:03:47,292 --> 00:03:49,456
>> you're just, you hit the ground running.
>> I wing it.

52
00:03:49,457 --> 00:03:51,940
>> Wow! >> Yeah, I hit the ground running.
>> That's great.  >> I read a lot cold. Yeah.

53
00:03:51,941 --> 00:03:56,186
>> Okay. So what happens when you come across
a word that you're not sure how to pronounce?

54
00:03:56,187 --> 00:03:58,848
>> Oh, this happens every day.
>> Yeah.  What do you do?

55
00:03:58,849 --> 00:04:01,062
>> You say it quickly.

56
00:04:01,063 --> 00:04:05,146
>> That's a good tip. >> And you roll your R
if it's a Spanish word, or. No, actually,

57
00:04:05,147 --> 00:04:10,425
I feel that because of my, my other languages,
it does help me in that   >> Yeah.  >> regard.

58
00:04:10,426 --> 00:04:13,551
I mean...  >> Definitely.  >> You know, when
you have a romance language background,

59
00:04:13,552 --> 00:04:17,743
I think you can sort of figure out
pronunciations a lot more easily. >> Mm-hmm.

60
00:04:17,744 --> 00:04:21,632
Awesome. >> Yeah. >> Well, do you have a
favorite word in American English that's

61
00:04:21,633 --> 00:04:24,402
especially fun to pronounce, or
has a special meaning for you,

62
00:04:24,403 --> 00:04:28,085
or that you find you use a lot
when you're speaking?

63
00:04:28,086 --> 00:04:32,304
>> Um, that's a tough one. I mean, I don't
know that I necessarily have a favorite word.

64
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:36,414
I would say, a word that is universal,
that in any language you can pretty much

65
00:04:36,415 --> 00:04:39,951
understand is 'hello'. And I think
it's a warm and happy word.

66
00:04:39,951 --> 00:04:44,250
And, usually with a smile on your face, it's
>> Great. >> the best way to approach people.

67
00:04:44,251 --> 00:04:50,437
>> That's a great word. Now, do you have any
words that, even for you, as a native speaker,

68
00:04:50,438 --> 00:04:53,536
you know that you have a tendency
to trip over as you say them?

69
00:04:53,537 --> 00:04:55,872
>> Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious,

70
00:04:55,873 --> 00:04:58,848
which I never come across in a news
script, so that's a good thing.

71
00:04:58,849 --> 00:05:01,592
>> And you just did a great job with it!
So, perfect!

72
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:07,235
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.
What is that word?

73
00:05:07,236 --> 00:05:12,080
It's a nonsense word from the musical
Mary Poppins. Check it out here.

74
00:05:12,081 --> 00:05:13,581
>> Well, Natalie,
>> I wouldn't know how to spell it!  So,

75
00:05:13,582 --> 00:05:16,261
>> Thank you so much for your time.
>> Thank you.  >> I really appreciate it

76
00:05:16,262 --> 00:05:19,319
>> Nice to meet you. >> I know my
audience really appreciates it too.
