00:00:00,149 --> 00:00:07,100
In this American English pronunciation video,
we'll look at English in action and take a

2
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:11,559
look at the 'aa' vowel followed by nasal consonants.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,179
>> Hey Jovon, happy Easter.
>> Oh, hey, happy Easter.

4
00:00:22,179 --> 00:00:24,580
>> Hi Ben.
>> Hello Rachel.

5
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:26,289
>> Happy Easter.
>> Happy Easter.

6
00:00:26,289 --> 00:00:28,949
>> Ben brought a ham for us to eat.
>> I brought a ham.

7
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:35,130
>> Ben brings a ham every year because he's
a dear. And I don't mean deer the animal,

8
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:41,070
I mean dear, D-E-A-R, a kind and thoughtful
person. 'Dear' and 'deer' are homophones.

9
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:45,650
>> What is this, Ben?
>> This is a ham. And it is made with pineapple

10
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:52,340
and brown sugar.
>> Oh, delicious. Ham. This is a teachable moment.

11
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:56,820
>> Here comes the ham. Now the word ham --
>> (it's really hot)

12
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:02,560
>> -- is an interesting word because it's
the AA as in BAT vowel followed by a nasal

13
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:09,360
consonant, in this case, M. So even though
it's written in IPA just with the H consonant,

14
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:16,350
AA vowel, and M consonant, it's not actually
pronounced that way. That would be "haam",

15
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:25,510
"haam". But we say, ha-uh-m. And there's that
UH sound that's not accounted for in IPA:

16
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:33,140
aa-uh, aa-uh. Ham. So, if you add this UH
sound to your AA vowel, you'll sound much

17
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:43,530
more American. Other examples, camera. AA-UH-M.
Cam-, Camera. This is also true if the sound

18
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:53,860
after the AA is the N sound. For example,
'ant'. AA-UHnt. Ant. Now, one last thing.

19
00:01:53,860 --> 00:02:00,140
If the AA vowel is followed by the NG consonant,
then it changes also, but, in a different

20
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:07,000
way. In that case it becomes a sound more
like the 'ay' diphthong, ay. For example,

21
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:19,040
in the word 'thanks': thanks. Or, bank, bank.
So pronounce your AA vowel this way when it's

22
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,029
followed by N, M, or NG.

23
00:02:22,029 --> 00:02:26,680
>> Michelle, what are you working on here?
>> I'm making Eggs Benedict.

24
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,659
>> Ooo.
>> So I'm poaching eggs --

25
00:02:28,659 --> 00:02:32,669
>> Uh-huh.
>> And then making them with salmon and spinach.

26
00:02:32,669 --> 00:02:34,259
>> Oh, that looks delicious.

27
00:02:34,259 --> 00:02:40,290
>> Jovon's always taking pictures. It's a
good thing I'm used to the camera, right?

28
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:45,659
So this is what I made for our meal. Some
green---it probably doesn't look as good under

29
00:02:45,659 --> 00:02:53,040
plastic, eh? Some asparagus. I roasted it
yesterday, gonna serve it chilled with a dijon

30
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,309
vinaigrette. Yum.

31
00:02:54,309 --> 00:03:00,409
>> What did you make, Kate?
>> I made Easter egg chocolate / peanut butter

32
00:03:00,409 --> 00:03:02,930
candy.
>> Oo, that looks good. Now these are special,

33
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:04,730
right?
>> They're special: they're vegan.

34
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:06,889
>> They're vegan.
>> No dairy.

35
00:03:06,889 --> 00:03:13,519
>> Wow. Let me zoom up on that. Jovon's been
trying to sneak one of those ever since you

36
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,389
made them yesterday.

37
00:03:16,389 --> 00:03:22,000
>> I found the little ladle. That's a hard
little phrase. Say that five times quickly!

38
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,009
Little ladle [x5].

39
00:03:27,009 --> 00:03:31,779
>> Ben, this ham is delicious.
>> Thanks.

40
00:03:31,779 --> 00:03:37,609
>> You guys are so clear, such good actors
for my Rachel's English audience. Totally

41
00:03:37,609 --> 00:03:39,849
natural.
>> They're hamming it up.

42
00:03:39,849 --> 00:03:47,639
>> They are hamming it up. Thank you, Matthew,
for brining up another use of the word 'ham'.

43
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:55,809
Matthew cleverly pointed out a second definition
for the word 'ham'. An actor or performer

44
00:03:55,809 --> 00:04:05,669
who overacts. As a verb: to act with exaggerated
expression of emotion, to overact. So the

45
00:04:05,669 --> 00:04:13,449
idiom, to ham it up, simply means, to overact.
Example sentence: He really hammed it up for

46
00:04:13,449 --> 00:04:14,319
the camera.

47
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:17,139
>> Happy Easter, guys.
>> Happy Easter, Rachel.

48
00:04:17,139 --> 00:04:20,539
>> Hope you're learning lots of fun vocabulary.
>> They are.

49
00:04:20,539 --> 00:04:23,490
>> We learned all about the word 'ham'.
>> Ham.

50
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:25,520
>> Oo, ham.
>> That's a good one.

51
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,419
>> It is a good one and --
>> It's a nasal one.

52
00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:29,849
>> -- it's sort of an odd word because it's
got this AA-UH sound.

53
00:04:29,849 --> 00:04:35,639
>> haa, haaa. Like that.
>> Yeah. If you had to explain how you pronounce

54
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:40,069
'ham', what would you say?
>> Um, haa, aa. There's an H in there.

55
00:04:40,069 --> 00:04:43,490
>> Yes?
>> There's an A, with an aa, kind of an aa?

56
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:49,099
>> Very nasal aa sound.
>> M, and then an M, mm, mm.

57
00:04:49,099 --> 00:04:52,389
>> So if you had to say it in slow motion,
say it in slow motion.

58
00:04:52,389 --> 00:04:57,650
>> Haaauhm.
>> There you go! I heard that good UH sound.

59
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:59,909
HaQuyen?
>> Ham.

60
00:04:59,909 --> 00:05:09,050
Let's watch this in slow motion. As you know,
AA followed by M has an 'uh' sound. AA-uh,

61
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:16,889
AA-uh. You can see HaQuyen's tongue pull back
to make that UH sound before her lips close

62
00:05:16,889 --> 00:05:20,349
for the M.

63
00:05:20,349 --> 00:05:21,419
>> Ham.
>> Yeah, nice

64
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:23,849
>> Got that in the profile.
>> Yep, she gave the profile so we can see

65
00:05:23,849 --> 00:05:26,690
the movement of the tongue and everything.
Thanks guys!

66
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:29,020
>> You're welcome Rachel.
>> You're most welcome.

67
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:33,900
That's it, and thanks so much
for using Rachel's English.
