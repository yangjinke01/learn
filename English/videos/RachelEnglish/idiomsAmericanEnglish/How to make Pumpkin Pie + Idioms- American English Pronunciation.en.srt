1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:05,689
As it's almost Thanksgiving, today I'm going
to show you how to make one of my favorite

2
00:00:05,689 --> 00:00:10,690
Thanksgiving treats. And that is a pumpkin
pie, which we're going to make from scratch.

3
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:15,690
Of course, we'll also learn some about American
English pronunciation.

4
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:29,500
First, we pick out the pumpkin. 
>>What do you think of this one?

5
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:32,640
What do you think of this one? There's a lot

6
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:38,780
of reduction and linking happening in this
phrase. The T in the word 'what' is generally

7
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:45,780
pronounced as a stop, not released. However,
the next word is 'do', which begins with a

8
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:52,319
D sound. That's the same position as the T.
So in this particular case, rather than having

9
00:00:52,319 --> 00:00:59,420
a stop T go into a D, it's even more casual
and the T is dropped altogether. What do you

10
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:05,660
think? Wha-duh-yuh, wha-duh-yuh. This is a
common way to pronounce the word 'what' and

11
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:13,770
'do'. What do you think? What do you like?
What do you mean? ... for example. And you've

12
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:20,360
probably noticed that in the word 'do', the
oo vowel is reduced to the schwa. This is

13
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:26,620
the same as in the word 'you': the vowel is
reduced to the schwa. Wha-duh-yuh, wha-duh-yuh,

14
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:33,840
wha-duh-yuh. So those three unaccented words
are all linked together, low in pitch, very

15
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:40,380
smooth. Wha-duh-yuh, wha-duh-yuh, What do
you think? So the word 'think' is stressed,

16
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:46,580
none of the sounds reduce here. But the next
word, 'of', I pronounce this with only the

17
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:53,580
schwa sound. So I reduce it so much that the
vv, V sound is dropped altogether. What do

18
00:01:53,750 --> 00:02:00,560
you think of this one? So the word 'of' is
simply pronounce uh, uh, uh, uh-this one,

19
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,280
uh-this one. What do you think of this one?
Listen again.

20
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:07,280
>>What do you think of this one?

21
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:14,269
With the sugar pumpkin purchased: 
>>The first step is to cut the pumpkin in half.

22
00:02:14,269 --> 00:02:22,879
It's kind of hard to cut, if I remember correctly.
It's very firm. // This is my friend Laura. I

23
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:30,939
spent the weekend with her in Massachusetts
and we did lots of baking. >>Oo, beautiful.

24
00:02:30,939 --> 00:02:37,939
Next, pull out the pulp and the seeds. >>Ok,
you know what? I'm just going to go with the

25
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:46,849
hands. Much easier. // While we were in the kitchen,
we looked out the window and noticed the first

26
00:02:46,849 --> 00:02:53,450
snow of the season was beginning. >>If you'll
notice, we made some apple bran muffins to

27
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:58,810
tide us over while we're baking, along with
some homemade apple butter. Did you notice?

28
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:04,989
I used the idiom 'tide us over'. This means
to have a small amount of something for a

29
00:03:04,989 --> 00:03:11,469
short period of time until the issue can be
addressed in a larger way. For example, I

30
00:03:11,469 --> 00:03:17,930
had a small snack to tide me over until dinner.
He borrowed some money to tide him over until

31
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:23,810
his next paycheck. I picked up a few things
to tide us over until the weekend when we

32
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:29,609
can really go shopping. Listen again. >> We
made some apple bran muffins to tide us over

33
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:35,069
while we're baking, along with some homemade
apple butter. So that's going to be delicious,

34
00:03:35,069 --> 00:03:39,779
and we're going to eat that while the pumpkin
roasts. So now, we've put our two emptied-out

35
00:03:39,779 --> 00:03:47,450
halves on the baking pan, and we're going
to put it in the oven at 350 [degrees Fahrenheit]

36
00:03:47,450 --> 00:04:01,389
for about an hour, hour and a half. Let's
set the timer. Let's dig into these.

37
00:04:01,389 --> 00:04:08,010
Here I used the idiom to dig into something. This
means to start eating, especially something

38
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:14,440
you're excited about. Eating with enthusiasm.
Let's dig into these. Listen again.

39
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:18,440
>>Let's dig into these. 
>>Mark, what are you doing?

40
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:22,990
>>I am going to roast some pumpkin seeds,

41
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:28,940
which you guys extracted from the whole pumpkin.
>>Which is now out of the oven and cooling.

42
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:35,940
>>Put some seasoning salt, put a little cayenne
pepper, not too much. What else? Kinda just

43
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:42,840
eyeballing this here. Kinda just eyeballing
this here. Mark used the idiom to eyeball

44
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:48,430
something. That means he's not measuring.
He's just guessing the amounts of the spices

45
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:55,520
as he adds them to the seeds. Kinda just eyeballing
this here. >>What else? Kinda just eyeballing

46
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:00,680
this here. So when you scoop the seeds out
of the pumpkin, save them. Rinse them well

47
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:05,979
and separate them from the stringy orange
part of the pumpkin. Let them air dry some,

48
00:05:05,979 --> 00:05:13,740
and add some oil. Mark recommends using a
lot of salt. He also adds paprika, chili pepper,

49
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:19,150
and other spices to taste. Then put them in
the oven. When they start popping, they're

50
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:27,729
ready to be taken out. >>Oh, I heard that.
>>I heard it too. Oh! >>They're popping, indeed,

51
00:05:27,729 --> 00:05:34,699
so, we can take them out. Did you notice,
Mark reduced the word 'them' to the schwa

52
00:05:34,699 --> 00:05:42,919
and the M sound: uhm, uhm, take 'em, take
'em out. This is a common way to reduce the

53
00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:50,830
word 'them' in everyday speech. Take 'em out,
bring 'em here, give 'em water, for example.

54
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:57,610
Also notice Mark makes a stop T on the word
'out'. He does not release it: out. He simply

55
00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:03,830
brings his tongue into position for the T,
out, cutting off the sound. Take 'em out.

56
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:13,120
Listen again. >>They're popping indeed, so,
we can take them out. >>Yum, those look great.

57
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:22,740
Try one. Yum. >>Crunch? >>Mm, mm-hmm. Really
delicious. What do you think chef, are you

58
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:29,530
happy? >>Pretty happy. // Back to the pumpkin.
Once it's cooled, separate the skin from the

59
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:34,000
rest of the pumpkin. The skin does not go
into the pie.

60
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:42,500
Now Laura is going to puree
the pumpkin with an immersion blender.

61
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,150
>>Now we're going to put in some 
sugar, egg, evaporated

62
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:57,979
milk, some spices. For the full recipe, see
the description on YouTube under the video,

63
00:06:57,979 --> 00:07:04,979
or, see the link on my website. Now Laura
has loaded up the food processor... >>Yes.

64
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:13,680
>>...with all the ingredients for our homemade
pie crust. >>And now, we roll out the crust.

65
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:18,759
>>What's that you have under the crust? I
have a little plastic wrap underneath it so

66
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:22,740
that when it's time to transfer it, you just
scoop it up and turn it over and pull the

67
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:28,000
plastic off. >>I'm pretty serious about my
pies, it's true. I like a good pie.

68
00:07:31,969 --> 00:07:40,069
Ok, I think we're almost ready. And now, now normally,
you can use a pie pan, we're using a skillet,

69
00:07:40,069 --> 00:07:44,949
a cast-iron skillet, and I've found it makes
a really nice -- nicely done crust. It's not

70
00:07:44,949 --> 00:07:51,000
at all soggy on the bottom. Fast forward,
shaping the crust in the dish.

71
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:03,509
And now, we pour it in. 
>>How far up should I go?

72
00:08:03,509 --> 00:08:04,009
>>I think put all of it in. 
>>It's gonna be too much.

73
00:08:07,509 --> 00:08:15,169
It's gonna be too much. Did you notice
that Laura said 'gonna' instead of going to.

74
00:08:15,169 --> 00:08:22,409
It's gonna be too much. >>It's gonna be too
much. Oh my gosh, it's gonna fit. All of it

75
00:08:22,409 --> 00:08:30,560
is going to fit. That's one whole pumpkin,
folks. >>We've determined the pie is done.

76
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:44,740
So, she comes out of the oven. Now she's nice
and puffy, but this will collapse as it cools.

77
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:51,000
Let the pie cool for several hours. >>And
here is the finished product. Unfortunately

78
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:58,120
I have to show it to you by candle light because,
if you'll remember, that snow that we were

79
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:04,670
so excited about: we've gotten maybe 6 inches,
maybe more, and the power's out. It's been

80
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:11,750
out for a couple of hours. I expect it will
be out for the entire night. So, in the low

81
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:26,190
light, let's go ahead and cut the pie. Oh
yeah. So, mm, man, I've got to say, I'm pretty

82
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:35,839
excited about this. I've gotta say. The words
'I have got to' can reduce to 'I've gotta'

83
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:44,310
or even simply 'I gotta' in everyday conversation.
I gotta go, I gotta say, I gotta see that

84
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:51,310
... for example. Man, I've gotta say, I'm pretty
excited about this.

85
00:09:55,310 --> 00:10:02,000
Mm-hmm. It's really good.
Guten appetit!
