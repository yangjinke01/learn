1
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:10,480
Happy New Year everyone. I hope you had a
great time spending New Year's Eve and New

2
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:17,290
Year's Day with friends and family. 2010 was
an awesome year. Well, it had its ups and

3
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:22,340
downs I suppose for everybody, but, it was
a great year. And I want to thank everyone

4
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:28,430
who watched my videos, who contacted me with
a question, who was involved in the community

5
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:35,430
of Rachel's English on Facebook. And, I want
to thank everybody who told somebody else

6
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:41,280
about my website and my YouTube channel. I
know a lot of users did because they told

7
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:47,370
me. And that brings us to the idiom we are
going to go over today, spread the word. It's

8
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:52,469
what some of my users have been doing, and
I hope that they will continue to do. And

9
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:57,530
I'm inviting everyone who uses my website
to spread the word about Rachel's English

10
00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:05,780
because in 2011 I would love to quit my job
and have Rachel's English be what I do. Period.

11
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:12,780
The only thing I give my time to work-wise.
So let's go over the idiom to spread the word.

12
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:18,880
It means not just to tell one person, but
to tell many people. For example, I'm having

13
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:24,390
a party tonight, spread the word. That doesn't
mean tell John and Mary, it means tell everyone

14
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:31,270
you know. Another example sentence: Thanks
for using Rachel's English, and thanks for

15
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:35,979
helping to spread the word. As I said a lot
of people have already told me that they've

16
00:01:35,979 --> 00:01:40,810
done this. If they're a teacher perhaps they've
used it in their classroom, told students.

17
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:46,829
A student, maybe they've told fellow students,
their teachers, friends and family, some people

18
00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:52,000
have posted it to their friends on Facebook.
It's all so helpful in spreading the word,

19
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:59,000
and I thank you for it. Now, how to pronounce
spread the word. It begins with the SPR consonant

20
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:09,369
cluster, and you do go through all three of
those sounds: ss, pp, rr. Spr-, spr-, spre-.

21
00:02:09,369 --> 00:02:18,570
Opens into the 'eh' as in 'bed' vowel, spre-,
dd. The tongue comes up for the D: spread,

22
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:27,730
the. Voiced TH sound and the schwa, it's an
unaccented syllable. Spread the, spread the,

23
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:37,970
word. The W consonant sound, the R vowel/consonant
sound, ww, rr, dd. And the D sound. So the

24
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:46,570
lips start very tight for the W, rr, they
open a little bit for that R vowel, wor-,

25
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:56,140
wor-, d. And the tongue, which has been back
a bit for the R, wor-d, comes up and the top

26
00:02:56,140 --> 00:03:03,140
touches, dd, the roof of the mouth and pulls
down to make the D sound. So we've got the

27
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:09,170
W consonant, the R vowel/consonant sound,
it's just one sound here, and the D sound.

28
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:17,450
WW, rr, dd. Word. Spread the word. That's
it, and thanks so much for using Rachel's English
