00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:05,380
Hi everybody! This video is going to be a
little different from what you’re used to

2
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:12,080
seeing on Rachel’s English. This is a compilation
video where I’m taking several of my videos

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:18,530
and combining them into one longer video on
a single topic. What’s really exciting is

4
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:25,850
that we have another teacher helping with
this video. Jennifer of JenniferESL. She’s

5
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:32,300
been a popular YouTube English teacher since
2007 and I’m really excited that she’s

6
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:34,280
helping with this video.

7
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:38,400
Today’s topic: animal idioms.

8
00:00:45,489 --> 00:00:50,749
People are always asking me for more videos
on idioms. So today you’re going to learn

9
00:00:50,749 --> 00:01:00,359
a lot, all related to animals: chickens, horses,
and monkeys. All of these idioms are familiar

10
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:04,739
to Americans, and used in conversational English.

11
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:11,899
Let’s get started hearing from teacher JenniferESL
on idioms relating to chickens.

12
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:28,660
In our first set of expressions related to
chickens, we have two nouns. The first, chicken.

13
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:36,409
A chicken is a coward. If someone says ‘don’t
be a chicken’, they’re saying, ‘don’t

14
00:01:36,409 --> 00:01:44,310
be a coward’, don’t be scared. We can
say this in a teasing way, as a joke. But,

15
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:51,409
because chicken means coward, it’s an insult.
It can be offensive, so be careful.

16
00:01:51,409 --> 00:02:00,979
The second is a noun phrase, pecking order.
Pecking order. To peck is an action that chickens

17
00:02:00,979 --> 00:02:08,869
do with their beak, their mouth part. They
can peck at the ground. Peck, peck, peck.

18
00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:14,849
Pecking order refers to behavior within a
group. Not a group of chickens, but a group

19
00:02:14,849 --> 00:02:23,180
of people. Pecking order is hierarchy, it’s
everyone’s status within a group. If we

20
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:30,040
ask, “What’s the pecking order?”, we’re
asking what’s the ranking within a particular

21
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,800
social group.

22
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:43,860
In our second set of expressions related to
chickens, we have four verbs. The first, chicken

23
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:52,330
out. Chicken out. I already explained that
a chicken is a coward. So to ‘chicken out’

24
00:02:52,330 --> 00:03:00,030
is to decide not to do something because you’re
a coward. So if you chickened out, you didn’t

25
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:02,890
do something because you were too afraid.

26
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:13,000
Next, flew the coop, usually said in the past
tense. Flew the coop. A coop is a structure

27
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,750
where we keep chickens. It’s where they
live. If the chickens flew the coop, they

28
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:27,019
got out. If someone flew the coop, they left,
they’re gone for good. And it usually implies

29
00:03:27,019 --> 00:03:30,689
some sort of escape to freedom.

30
00:03:30,689 --> 00:03:38,390
Next, run around like a chicken with its head
cut off. It’s a very colorful and maybe

31
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:45,379
not-so-pleasant. But to run around like a
chicken with its head cut off means that someone

32
00:03:45,379 --> 00:03:53,040
is going around in a crazy rush with little
direction and no clear thinking. They’re

33
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:58,180
very stressed and worried. They’re running
around like a chicken with it’s head cut

34
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:59,769
off.

35
00:03:59,769 --> 00:04:06,840
And last, we have ‘walk on egg shells’,
often used in the progressive, walking on

36
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:14,610
eggshells. Egg shells break, they crack easily.
If you’re trying not to crack these eggshells,

37
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:22,210
you’re walking carefully. If you’re walking
on eggshells, you’re trying to be very careful.

38
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:30,160
You’re afraid that maybe something you say
or something that you do could offend or upset

39
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:38,100
someone. So if you’re walking on eggshells,
you’re being very careful not to upset anyone.

40
00:04:39,949 --> 00:04:46,539
One time I got to see a chicken being slaughtered,
so I literally got to see a chicken run around

41
00:04:46,539 --> 00:04:52,729
with it’s head cut off. It was pretty out
of control. Thanks so much to Jennifer for

42
00:04:52,729 --> 00:04:59,259
teaching us those idioms. They’re all idioms
that are well-known and used, so don’t chicken

43
00:04:59,259 --> 00:05:04,000
out, do try using them in speech.

44
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,900
Because people used to use horses a lot for
work and transportation, there are a lot of

45
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:16,500
horse idioms. One night a couple of years
ago, I was wearing a big horse mask in lower

46
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:23,590
Manhattan and got inspired with my friends
to come up with as many horse idioms as we

47
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:24,490
could.

48
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:31,729
Would you believe we came up with almost 20
phrases and idioms that use the word horse,

49
00:05:31,729 --> 00:05:36,949
or somehow reference horses. And, I’m sure
there are more.

50
00:05:36,949 --> 00:05:39,840
>>Get off your high horse.
>> Get off your high horse. That’s a perfect one.

51
00:05:39,849 --> 00:05:41,329
>> Lori ...
>> Stop horsing around.

52
00:05:41,329 --> 00:05:45,549
>> These are, you have so many idioms!
>> Yeah, I’m cheating.

53
00:05:45,549 --> 00:05:51,400
Get off your high horse. To be on a ‘high
horse’ is to have an attitude of arrogance,

54
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:57,280
of self-righteousness. ‘Get off your high
horse’ means, stop being so arrogant. You

55
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:02,910
have a couple options with the T in ‘get’.
You can either make it a flap T, connecting

56
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:08,810
it to the word ‘off’, get off, get off.
Or, if you’re really emphasizing and going

57
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:17,710
to make a pause, you can make it a stop T.
Get off. Get off your high horse. Stop horsing

58
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:26,229
around. Horsing around is rough or rowdy play,
usually in good fun. My mom often accused

59
00:06:26,229 --> 00:06:28,439
my brother and I of horsing around.

60
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:35,100
>> Horse idioms. We have: don’t look a gift
horse in the mouth…

61
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:38,660
>> …you can lead a horse to water, but you
can’t make it drink,

62
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:39,900
>> …hoofing it.

63
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:46,050
Don’t look a gift horse in the mouth. This
means, don’t be ungrateful or suspicious

64
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:51,340
when someone gives you something. A friend
said this to me recently when I was talking

65
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:55,720
about an offer that I got from someone to
help me with my business. And I was a little

66
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:00,940
suspicious. He said, “You know, Rachel,
don’t look a gift horse in the mouth.”

67
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:06,520
You can lead a horse to water, but you can’t
make it drink. This basically means, you can’t

68
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:13,220
make people do what they don’t want to do.
Let’s talk a little bit about the pronunciation.

69
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:20,220
You can lead a horse. So the main verb here
is the word ‘lead’. That means ‘can’

70
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:25,800
is a helping verb. So we don’t want to say
‘can’. We instead want to reduce that

71
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:33,250
word to ‘kn’, ‘kn’. You can lead.
You can lead a horse to water. But you can’t

72
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:39,979
make it drink. You might hear a CH sound happening
between ‘but’ and ‘you’, but you,

73
00:07:39,979 --> 00:07:48,270
but you. This can happen when the T is followed
by the Y consonant, but you, but you. But

74
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:53,759
you can’t make it drink. You can lead a
horse to water, but you can’t make it drink.

75
00:07:53,759 --> 00:08:00,819
Hoofing it means to be moving really fast,
to be running somewhere. For example, I hoofed

76
00:08:00,819 --> 00:08:07,409
it to work because I overslept. Note that
the double-O here is pronounced as the UH

77
00:08:07,409 --> 00:08:11,779
vowel, just like cook, book, and Brooklyn.

78
00:08:11,779 --> 00:08:16,749
>> Straight from the horse’s mouth.
>> Making hay.

79
00:08:16,749 --> 00:08:18,889
>> A charlie horse.

80
00:08:18,889 --> 00:08:25,039
Straight from the horse’s mouth means that
you’ve something from the most authoritative

81
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:28,830
or dependable source. For example:

82
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:34,290
>> Did you hear Jane is quitting her job?
>> No way. Where did you hear that?

83
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:38,190
>> From Jane herself. Straight from the horse’s
mouth.

84
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:46,320
Making hay, or, making hay while the sun shines.
This is to make the most of current opportunities.

85
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:53,460
If you put doing something off, you may loose
the opportunity to do it. For example, let’s

86
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:56,610
make hay and go for a run before it starts
raining again.

87
00:08:56,610 --> 00:09:04,340
A charlie horse. This phrase is used for muscle
cramps in the legs. You might hear this phrase

88
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:06,620
as you watch the Olympics this summer.

89
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:09,960
>> I could eat a horse.
>> I’m so hungry I could eat a horse. That’s

90
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:13,300
true.
>> Did we say don’t beat a dead horse? Don’t

91
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,760
beat a dead horse.

92
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:20,800
I could eat a horse. Well, this means, of
course, that you’re very very hungry. Notice

93
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:28,040
the T at the end of the word ‘eat’ links
to the next word, a, a schwa sound, so it’s

94
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:35,510
a flap T or a light D sound. Eat a, eat a,
eat a. I could eat a horse.

95
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:40,540
>> Rachel, are you hungry?
>> Yeah, I skipped lunch, so I could eat a

96
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:41,500
horse.

97
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:49,250
Don’t beat a dead horse. You might say this
to someone who can’t let a situation go.

98
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:54,530
If you think someone needs to accept things
as they are, and they just keep talking about

99
00:09:54,530 --> 00:10:00,720
‘what if?’, ‘what if?’, then you might
say: Look, don’t beat a dead horse. It’s

100
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,640
done.
>> Don’t put the cart before the horse.

101
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,380
>> That’s a horse of a different color.

102
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:14,920
Don’t put the cart before the horse. This
means be patient and do things the right way,

103
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:20,290
in the right order. Sometimes it’s very
tempting to do things out of order and skip

104
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:26,670
ahead. But it doesn’t always get the best
results. Someone might say to you: do it right,

105
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:29,470
don’t put the cart before the horse.

106
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:35,110
A horse of a different color. That is when
you bring something up that is unlike that

107
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:41,670
which you are already talking about. For example,
to me, writing and spelling are easy. But

108
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:47,160
math, that’s a horse of a different color.
Meaning, to me, math is very hard.

109
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:52,140
>> Oh, there are so many idioms with ‘horse’!
>> Hold your horses!

110
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:55,160
>> Hold your horses!
>> That’s a great one.

111
00:10:55,160 --> 00:11:01,960
Hold your horses. That means hold on, be patient,
stop what you’ve just started. It’s among

112
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:08,410
the most common of these horse idioms. Notice
I’mreducing the word ‘your’ to ‘yer’,

113
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:11,250
‘yer’. Hold your horses.

114
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:17,260
>> This is a one-horse town. Put a horse out
to pasture.

115
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:25,230
A one-horse town is a small, maybe insignificant
town. For example, he’s very overwhelmed

116
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:28,000
by the city, he comes from a one-horse town.

117
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,670
To put a horse out to pasture. This is when
a racing horse is retired, but it can also

118
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:39,570
be used with people, when someone is forced
to retire. For example, Larry is past retirement

119
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:43,149
age. I think it’s time to put him out to
pasture.

120
00:11:43,149 --> 00:11:48,229
>> Wild horses couldn’t drag him away.
>> Oh that’s a good one. I use that sometimes.

121
00:11:48,229 --> 00:11:53,060
My friend used that once recently.
Wild horses couldn’t drag him away. This

122
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:58,850
is said when someone is very engrossed in
or committed to something. Nothing can persuade

123
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:03,680
him or her to leave or stop doing that thing.
For example,

124
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:10,420
>> Are you watching the Mad Men Finale tonight?
>> Yes, wild horses couldn’t drag me away.

125
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:12,560
>> A dark horse candidate, for example.

126
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:19,620
A dark horse is someone who is more or less
unknown who emerges to a place of prominence

127
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:25,200
or importance, usually in a competition. This
is used quite a bit to describe a candidate

128
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,170
in politics.

129
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:32,850
After doing our idiom research, we went out
to dinner, and then made our way home. Although,

130
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:38,370
I can’t really recommend riding a bike in
the horse mask, because essentially, I could

131
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:42,550
not see a thing out of it.

132
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:49,960
And finally, a few monkey idioms. At the YouTube
space in Los Angeles, I found a monkey suit,

133
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:56,430
and couldn’t resist going over a few monkey
idioms in costume.

134
00:12:56,430 --> 00:13:01,870
To begin, let’s go over the pronunciation
of the word ‘monkey’. This is a two-syllable

135
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:09,760
word with stress on the first syllable. DA-da,
monkey. It begins with the M consonant sound,

136
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:16,940
where the lips come together. MMmmmo-. Then
we have the UH as in BUTTER sound. This is

137
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:23,170
a completely relaxed sound. So, your tongue
should be forward and relaxed, uh, uh, a little

138
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:29,440
bit of jaw drop, and your lips should be completely
relaxed. MMmmmo-. Because this is a stressed

139
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:36,240
syllable, it should have the up-down shape
of a stressed syllable in the voice. Mo-,

140
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,600
mon-.

141
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:44,830
Now we have the NG sound. The reason why the
letter N is representing the NG sound is because

142
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:49,810
the next sound is the K, and they’re made
in the same spot. So, to make the NG sound,

143
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:53,690
the tongue tip is here, touching behind the
bottom front teeth, and the back part of the

144
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:59,140
tongue reaches up and touches the soft palate.
The soft palate is lowered here because it’s

145
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:08,560
a nasal consonant, ng, ng-k. Then, to make
the K, you just release the tongue down, monk-,

146
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:15,700
-k-. The soft palate will close for that.
Then we go into the EE as in SHE vowel. Monkey.

147
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:21,660
Since it’s in an unstressed syllable, it
should be very short and low in pitch, -key,

148
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:24,150
-key, -key. Monkey.

149
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:30,370
Let’s get into some idioms. First, ‘fun
as a barrel of monkeys’. This means something

150
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:35,750
that’s really fun, kind of like this video.
But I usually use it sarcastically, which

151
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:40,480
means that I am explaining something that
is not at all fun. For example, I’m going

152
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:46,240
to the dentist to have a cavity filled. Fun
as a barrel of monkeys. The stress pattern

153
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:52,960
for this phrase is DA-da-da-DA-da. Barrel
of monkeys. So, in many cases we’ll reduce

154
00:14:52,960 --> 00:15:00,450
the word ‘of’ to just have the schwa sound,
no consonant at all. Barrel of, DA-da-da,

155
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:06,300
Barrel of. Barrel of monkeys. Now here we’re
making ‘monkey’ plural, so the S will

156
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:14,100
be a Z sound, zz, because the sound before
was a vowel. Monkeys, monkeys. So just a very

157
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:19,770
quick, soft Z sound at the end there. Barrel
of monkeys.

158
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:25,200
Monkey business. This can mean silliness.
So you might say to a room full of rowdy kids,

159
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:30,990
‘Enough with the monkey business’. But,
it can also mean dishonest behavior. Monkey

160
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:38,460
business. DA-da-DA-da. So, the first syllable
of ‘business’ is also stressed. This stressed

161
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:45,700
syllable has the IH as in SIT vowel, bu-,
bu-, and the first S here represents the Z

162
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:53,140
sound. Bus-, business. The second syllable,
since it’s unstressed, should be very quick,

163
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:58,690
-ness, -ness, -ness. Business. Monkey business.

164
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:03,400
Monkey suit. That’s what I’m wearing!
That’s the literal meaning. But there’s

165
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:09,540
also an idiomatic meaning, and that’s a
tuxedo or other formal evening wear for men.

166
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:16,750
Monkey suit. DA-da-da. Monkey suit. So, the
word ‘suit’ has the S consonant sound.

167
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:23,120
The letters U-I represent the OO as in BOO
vowel, and we finish with a Stop T. Monkey

168
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:29,580
suit, monkey suit.
Monkey on my back. This is a problem or something

169
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:34,840
that’s really stressful that’s taking
a long time to resolve or won’t go away.

170
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:40,240
For example, my friend is going through a
nasty divorce. It’s a monkey on his back.

171
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:47,140
The stress pattern is DA-da-da-da-DA. Monkey
on his back. So, ‘back’ is stressed. The

172
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:52,010
words ‘on’, and the next function word,
whether it’s ‘my’, ‘your’, ‘his’,

173
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:57,830
or ‘her’, will be unstressed. So, ‘on
my’, ‘on my’, those two words will be

174
00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:04,470
really quick, low in pitch, and not too clear,
on my, on my. Or, it could be ‘on your’,

175
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:10,170
‘on your’. Notice I’m reducing the word
‘your’ to ‘yer’. We’ve already made

176
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:16,670
a video about that, so check it out. ‘On
his’ or ‘on her’. In both of those cases,

177
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:24,280
we’ll probably drop the H. On his, on his,
monkey on his back. Or, on her, on her, monkey

178
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:29,540
on her back. Check out this video on Dropping
the H Reductions.

179
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:34,800
Have you ever heard someone say “I’m going
to go ape.” That means to get really angry.

180
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:41,450
For example, if she screws up my car, I’m
going to go ape. Both ‘go’ and ‘ape’

181
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:48,290
are stressed, so the stress pattern is DA-DA.
Go ape. We have the G consonant sound and

182
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:53,980
the OH as in NO diphthong. Sometimes my students
don’t round their lips enough for the second

183
00:17:53,980 --> 00:18:01,740
half of this diphthong, go, go, so make sure
you do that. Ape. It begins with the AY as

184
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:07,580
in SAY diphthong. Make sure you drop your
jaw enough for the first sound of that diphthong,

185
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:14,780
a-, a-pe. And finally, the P sound, ape. Go
ape.

186
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:20,360
Not all rodents are cute, but this one is.
This is from my children’s collection of

187
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:27,660
stuffed animals and hand puppets. I’m not
even certain if this is a mouse or a rat,

188
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:36,510
but seeing it reminds me of an idiom we have
in English, rat race. ‘Rat race’ refers

189
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:42,730
to the daily struggle to be successful at
work where there’s competition and pressure

190
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:49,850
to produce. One day after the other you go
through this routine hoping to come out on

191
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:57,850
top. But really, you’re one of thousands.
‘Rat race’ refers to this whole situation.

192
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:10,020
Many complain about the rat race and say they
hate the rat race. Some think about quitting

193
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:18,120
the rat race. Others actually leave the rat
race behind. They change jobs or they change

194
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:24,620
their lifestyle. Maybe they retire early,
or move out to the country where life is more

195
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:26,440
peaceful.

196
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:34,520
You’ve just learned a lot of idioms. Challenge
