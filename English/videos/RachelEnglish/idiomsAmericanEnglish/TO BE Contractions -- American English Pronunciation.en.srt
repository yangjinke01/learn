1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:05,810
In this American English pronunciation video,
we're going to learn some Vietnamese cooking,

2
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:10,010
and you're going to study contraction of the
verb TO BE.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,430
One thing to note about these contractions
is that no extra syllable is added. We'll

4
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:27,710
go over the pronunciations. You'll notice
that some of them have two different pronunciations.

5
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:35,100
That's because there can be a reduced pronunciation.
I do recommend that you use the reduced pronunciation.

6
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:40,149
Any time you can make a short word shorter
it's going to add better rhythmic contrast

7
00:00:40,149 --> 00:00:41,530
to your speech.

8
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:53,170
So, I am. I'm. I'm. You are. This can be 'your'
or, better yet, let's reduce it, 'yer'. Notice

9
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:58,109
how quick it is. When we reduce it, it's going
to be very, very fast, and it must be linked to

10
00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:09,640
the next word. 'We are' can be 'we're', or
'we're', or, better yet, wur, wur. Reduced.

11
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:23,540
'They are' can be 'they're', or, reduced, thur.
He is, she is, it is. This will be come he's,

12
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:31,180
she's, it's. Notice that the S in 'it's' is
pronounced as an S sound, unvoiced. That's

13
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:37,790
because the sound before is the T, also an
unvoiced sound. It's, it's. However, the S

14
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:44,310
in 'he's' and 'she's' is a Z sound. That's
voiced, because the sound before, a vowel,

15
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:52,310
was voiced. He's, she's, it's. TS can be a
tough sound, and I do have a video on how

16
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:57,129
to make that sound. So let's take a look at
some contractions in everyday conversation.

17
00:01:57,129 --> 00:02:01,260
>> Alright, Annie. So after you peel the cucumber,
you're going to slice the cucumber into rounds.

18
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:05,730
And then you're going to flatten the rounds,
and slice them lengthwise again to make it

19
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:07,230
into a nice julienne.

20
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:14,680
Did you notice the contraction of 'you are'
to 'yer'? Yer, you're going to. Listen again.

21
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:19,019
>> Alright, Annie. So after you peel the cucumber,
you're going to slice the cucumber into rounds.

22
00:02:19,019 --> 00:02:23,069
And then you're going to flatten the rounds,
and slice them lengthwise again to make it

23
00:02:23,069 --> 00:02:25,530
into a nice julienne.
>> How's this, HaQuyen?

24
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:28,879
>> It looks good, looks good, it's good.

25
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:39,099
How's this? How's, how's, zz, zz, with a Z
sound. It's good. It is, it's, it's, with

26
00:02:39,099 --> 00:02:42,489
that TS sound. Listen again.

27
00:02:42,489 --> 00:02:46,090
>> How's this, HaQuyen?
>> It looks good, looks good, it's good.

28
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:50,780
>> Well, if we look at the way Mark's chopping
his mushrooms, we can see that he's doing

29
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:56,319
quite a good job of it.
>> Thanks, HaQuyen.

30
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:03,129
Mark's, Mark's. The last sound of Mark's name
is the K sound, unvoiced. So the apostrophe

31
00:03:03,129 --> 00:03:13,670
S is also unvoiced. Ks, ks, Mark's, Mark's.
We also heard 'he's', where the apostrophe

32
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:19,620
S is a Z sound. He's, he's, he's doing. Listen
again.

33
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:24,620
>> Well, if we look at the way Mark's chopping
his mushrooms, we can see that he's doing

34
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:29,309
quite a good job of it.
>> Thanks, HaQuyen.

35
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:31,689
>> That's because she's a good teacher.

36
00:03:31,689 --> 00:03:39,730
Here, Natalie, speaking of HaQuyen, said that's,
that's, that's because, with the TS sound.

37
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:48,040
She's, she's a good teacher. She's a, she's
a, where the apostrophe S is a Z sound. Listen

38
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:48,409
again.

39
00:03:48,409 --> 00:03:53,549
>> That's because she's a good teacher.
>> Well, I'm going to dice up this cucumber

40
00:03:53,549 --> 00:04:00,430
as I was instructed.
>> I'm going to keep dicing the mushrooms.

41
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:08,099
Here, both Annie and Mark said I'm gonna.
So, they have contracted I AM and also reduced

42
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:16,160
'going to' to 'gonna'. I'm gonna. Notice how
'I'm' is the most stressed syllable in that

43
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:23,199
fragment. I'm gonna. That's because 'going'
is a helping verb here, not the main verb.

44
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:32,030
The main verb is stressed. For example, Annie
said 'I'm gonna dice'. I'm gonna dice, Stressing

45
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:34,610
'dice'. Listen again.

46
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:40,039
>> Well, I'm going to dice up this cucumber
as I was instructed.

47
00:04:40,039 --> 00:04:44,870
>> I'm going to keep dicing the mushrooms.
>> Hey Annie, when are the noodles going to

48
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:48,930
be ready?
>> They're going to be ready in about 10 minutes.

49
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:57,449
They're gonna. Did you hear how Annie reduced
'they're' to thur, thur, thur, they're gonna.

50
00:04:57,449 --> 00:04:59,810
They're gonna be ready. Listen again.

51
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:02,320
>> Hey Annie, when are the noodles going to
be ready?

52
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,300
>> They're going to be ready in about 10 minutes.

53
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:08,099
>> I think we're all set with the basil.
>> Thanks, Lori.

54
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:17,900
We're all set. Did you hear Lori's reduction
of 'we're' to wur, wur, wur, we're all set.

55
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:24,310
All set is a common idiom meaning ready, or
not in need of anything. Here, she is saying

56
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:30,199
the basil is ready for the dish. I use it
often at a restaurant, for example, when a

57
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:38,210
waiter asks if there is anything more I need.
Nope, I'm all set, I'll say. Listen again.

58
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:41,090
>> I think we're all set with the basil.
>> Thanks, Lori.

59
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:43,780
>> I love HaQuyen. She's such an effective
teacher.

60
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:47,669
>> That's true. HaQuyen, thanks so much for
teaching us how to make all this amazing food.

61
00:05:47,669 --> 00:05:50,939
>> Thanks for coming and joining me to eat
all this wonderful food.

62
00:05:50,939 --> 00:05:55,170
>> Any time. We will eat your food any time.
>> Yes, we will.

63
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:55,449
>> Love it.

64
00:05:55,449 --> 00:06:04,770
She's, she's, she's such, with the apostrophe
S pronounced as a Z. That's, that's true,

65
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:07,639
with the TS sound. Listen again.

66
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:11,229
>> I love HaQuyen. She's such an effective
teacher.

67
00:06:11,229 --> 00:06:14,489
>> That's true. HaQuyen, thanks so much for
teaching us how to make all this amazing food.

68
00:06:14,489 --> 00:06:18,260
>> Thanks for coming and joining me to eat
all this wonderful food.

69
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:21,970
>> Any time. We will eat your food any time.
>> Yes, we will.

70
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:22,930
>> Love it.

71
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:26,509
>> I'm crushing it over here, as you may be
able to see.

72
00:06:26,509 --> 00:06:30,990
>> He's crushing it.
>> I'm adding noodles.

73
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:35,159
>> I'm adding tofu.
>> I'm waiting for shrimp.

74
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:38,069
>> I'm adding bean sprouts.

75
00:06:38,069 --> 00:06:46,259
I'm. Lots of I'm in this clip. Also Mark used
the idiom 'to crush' -- meaning he thinks

76
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:52,000
he is doing an excellent job of making a summer
roll. There are lots of different ways to

77
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,240
use the word 'crush'. For example to say you
have a crush on someone means you like that

78
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:04,990
person, you have romantic interest in that
person. Let's listen again to all these I'm

79
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:06,729
contractions.

80
00:07:06,729 --> 00:07:11,490
>> I'm crushing it over here, as you may be
able to see.

81
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:14,780
>> He's crushing it.
>> I'm adding noodles.

82
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:19,160
>> I'm adding tofu.
>> I'm waiting for shrimp.

83
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,560
>> I'm adding bean sprouts.

84
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,969
>> That chicken's looking good.

85
00:07:23,969 --> 00:07:31,219
That chicken's looking good. Natalie contracted
'chicken is' to chicken's, that chicken's

86
00:07:31,219 --> 00:07:37,139
looking good. And it was good. It was delicious!
Listen again.

87
00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:38,830
>> That chicken's looking good.

88
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:41,409
>> There is onion in there.
>> There's no onion in there.

89
00:07:41,409 --> 00:07:43,379
>> I...
>> That one's mine.

90
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:47,550
>> Wait, where's the onion? Oh, spring onion.

91
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:55,819
There's no onion in there, where's the onion.
There's, where's. Both of these words end

92
00:07:55,819 --> 00:08:04,120
in the R sound, a voiced consonant, so the
apostrophe S is a Z sound. There's, there's.

93
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:10,560
Where's, where's. There's no onion, where's
the onion. Listen again.

94
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,390
>> There is onion in there.
>> There's no onion in there.

95
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:15,470
>> I...
>> That one's mine.

96
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:19,449
>> Wait, where's the onion? Oh, spring onion.

97
00:08:19,449 --> 00:08:23,979
>> Annie, hold it up.
>> Look at that. That's absolute perfection.

98
00:08:23,979 --> 00:08:25,539
>> It does look great.

99
00:08:25,539 --> 00:08:34,089
You've got to love Annie's enthusiasm. That's
absolute perfection. That's, that's, again,

100
00:08:34,089 --> 00:08:37,279
with the TS sound. Listen again.

101
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:42,320
>> Annie, hold it up.
>> Look at that. That's absolute perfection.

102
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,250
>> It does look great.

103
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:46,830
>> Oh god, my dogs are barking.
>> Why is that, Hillary?

104
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:50,589
>> We've been walking around all day.
>> Not to mention all the dancing you did

105
00:08:50,589 --> 00:08:53,000
last night.
>> Oh, it was amazing.

106
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:01,130
My dogs are barking. This is a great idiom
to mean your feet are tired. My dogs are barking.

107
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:08,899
Notice how the word 'are' is reduced to er,
er, er, My dogs are, my dogs are. My dogs

108
00:09:08,899 --> 00:09:17,959
are barkin'. Notice also the ING is pronounced
as an IN. My dogs are barkin' instead of dogs

109
00:09:17,959 --> 00:09:24,569
are barking. You may find this happening sometimes
with certain phrases or idioms. Listen again.

110
00:09:24,569 --> 00:09:28,340
>> Oh god, my dogs are barking.
>> Why is that, Hillary?

111
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:32,100
>> We've been walking around all day.
>> Not to mention all the dancing you did

112
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,260
last night.
>> Oh, it was amazing.

113
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:40,610
I hope this has made you more aware of just
how often we use this kind of contraction.

114
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:46,440
Watch this video a time or two. Then watch
an American TV show or movie, and see if you

115
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:54,250
can notice these 'to be' contractions. Write
them down as you watch and practice the phrases.

116
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:59,430
Using contractions will really help your speech
sound more natural.

117
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:05,059
That's it, and thanks so much
for using Rachel's English.

118
00:10:05,059 --> 00:10:08,000
Guys, that was fantastic.
