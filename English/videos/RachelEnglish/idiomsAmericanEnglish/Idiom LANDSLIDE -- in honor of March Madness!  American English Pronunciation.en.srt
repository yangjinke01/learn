In this American English pronunciation video,
we're going to go over the idiom 'landslide'.

2
00:00:13,549 --> 00:00:19,340
This idiom is in honor of March Madness, which
will start soon. March Madness is a college

3
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:24,420
basketball tournament that happens every year
about this time. A very exciting couple of

4
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:31,199
weeks for sports fans! A landslide victory,
or, to win in a landslide, is a victory by

5
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:37,520
a large margin. In basketball, maybe something
like 20 points. You could also use this term

6
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,289
to describe an election. He was elected Mayor
in a landslide.

7
00:00:42,289 --> 00:00:48,579
Landslide. Do you notice that I'm dropping
the D? When the D comes after an N and before

8
00:00:48,579 --> 00:00:57,879
another consonant, you can drop the D. Landslide.
Another example would be 'grandma'. No D sound

9
00:00:57,879 --> 00:01:00,250
there. Grandma.

10
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:06,240
This is a two-syllable word with stress on
the first syllable. Landslide. It begins with

11
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:15,270
the Light L, ll, tongue tip here. Ll, ll,
la-. Then the AA as in BAT vowel. Make sure

12
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:23,490
you drop your jaw for that. Laa, aa. Also
the top lip may pull up a bit. La-, la-. Next

13
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:29,409
is the nasal consonant N. And you may know
that AA followed by a nasal consonant isn't

14
00:01:29,409 --> 00:01:36,700
really a pure AA. We have an 'uh' sound in
there, where the tongue relaxes in the back.

15
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:45,850
La-uh-, la-uh-n. Before the front raises for
the N sound. Lan, nn, nn. So it's the front,

16
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:53,259
flat part of the tongue that is touching the
roof of the mouth there for the N. Lan, landsss-,

17
00:01:53,259 --> 00:02:00,189
then the S consonant sound. The teeth come
together, ss, and the tongue then goes to

18
00:02:00,189 --> 00:02:05,130
the roof of the mouth for the L. For the N
it was touching like this, and for the L it

19
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:12,290
touches like this, with the very tip. Then
the AI as in BUY diphthong. Again, drop your

20
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:20,960
jaw for the first sound of the diphthong.
-sli-. And finally, a light D at the end,

21
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:29,380
where the flat part of the tongue will quickly
touch the roof of the mouth. Landslide, landslide,

22
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:31,230
landslide.

23
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:36,590
Practice your English. Make up a sentence
using 'landslide', record it, and post it

24
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:41,920
as a video response on YouTube to this video.
I can't wait to see it.

25
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:48,920
That's it, and thanks so much
for using Rachel's English.
