00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:06,350
In this American English pronunciation video,
I'm going to complain about how hot it is

2
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:07,450
in New York.

3
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:20,449
Summer in New York is great for things like
grilling. But it's also known for being hot,

4
00:00:20,449 --> 00:00:27,329
hot, hot. Sometimes entirely too hot. We've
had lots of days this month, July, that were

5
00:00:27,329 --> 00:00:32,599
very hot. Over ninety. Not surprising. So,
I'm going to teach you some idioms and some

6
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:37,600
creative ways to say "it's really hot!!"

7
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:44,679
Hot as Hades, or hot as hell. Now, be careful
when using hell, it is a mild cuss word, but

8
00:00:44,679 --> 00:00:50,050
it is considered a cuss word. So you don't
want to say it in front of people that might

9
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:55,999
be offended. The T in 'hot' comes between
two vowels here when we connect it to the

10
00:00:55,999 --> 00:01:03,339
next word. So, that's going to be a flap T.
Hot as, hot as. You'll notice I'm not saying

11
00:01:03,339 --> 00:01:15,780
'as'. I'm reducing the AA vowel to the schwa.
-duz, -duz, -duz, hot as, hot as. Hades begins

12
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:25,189
with the H consonant, has the 'ay' as in 'say'
diphthong, Ha-, Ha-, then the D consonant,

13
00:01:25,189 --> 00:01:33,240
ee vowel, Z sound. Hades, Hades. Stress on
the first syllable, so that should have more

14
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:40,810
shape, whereas -des, -des, -des should be
flatter and lower in pitch. Hot as Hades.

15
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:49,149
Or, hot as hell. Hell with the H consonant,
the EH vowel, and the dark L. Hell, hell.

16
00:01:49,149 --> 00:01:53,810
Now, being a stressed word, this syllable, 
this word should have some shape.

17
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:59,189
Hell, hell, hell.  Hot as hell.

18
00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:06,869
One phrase my Mom likes to use is 'hotter
than blazes'. Hotter than blazes. So, the

19
00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:15,410
word 'than' here is being reduced just to
the N consonant sound: hottern, hottern, hottern.

20
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:23,110
Now the T in 'hot', turned into a flap T,
or a D sound, because it's coming between

21
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:29,470
two vowels: hotter, hottern, hottern, hotter
than blazes. Blazes with the BL consonant

22
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:42,180
cluster, the 'ay' as in 'say' diphthong, and
the Z, I, Z: -zes, -zes, -zes. Hotter than blazes.

23
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:50,270
You can also say "it's a scorcher." Scorcher:
with the SK consonant cluster, sk, sk. The

24
00:02:50,270 --> 00:03:00,420
'aw' as in 'law' vowel followed by the R consonant,
scor-, scor-, and the second, unstressed syllable,

25
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:09,170
the ch CH sound, schwa, R sound: -cher, -cher,
-cher. Scorcher.

26
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:15,280
You can also say "it's so hot, you could fry
an egg on the sidewalk." Should I try it?

27
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,530
I don't think I will. Just seems like it might
be kind of messy.

28
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:28,030
There are also words you can use to show quantity.
It's not just hot, it's really hot. Or you

29
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:36,430
can, it's ridiculously hot. Or, it's super
hot. Or, in Boston / New England, you might

30
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:39,100
hear: it's wicked hot.

31
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:44,480
So, when it's the middle of July, and the
end of summer seems very far away, and you're

32
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:50,650
already tired of the heat, you're lucky that
you have these phrases that you can use that

33
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:57,880
are much more colorful than simply "it's hot"
to express your frustration. It's hot as hell.

34
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:05,100
It's hotter than blazes. That's it, and thanks
so much for using Rachel's English.

35
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:12,700
It's hot as hell. It's hotter than blazes.
Sirens are always ruining my take.
