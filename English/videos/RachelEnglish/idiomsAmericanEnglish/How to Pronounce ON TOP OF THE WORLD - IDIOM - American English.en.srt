In this American English pronunciation video,
we're going to go over the idiom on Top of

2
00:00:05,809 --> 00:00:07,009
the World.

3
00:00:14,419 --> 00:00:19,180
I'm on top of the world! What does it mean?
It doesn't mean that I'm hanging out at the

4
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:24,619
North Pole. It means I'm really happy, I'm
overjoyed. Maybe I just got a new job, or

5
00:00:24,619 --> 00:00:29,570
won the lottery! It feels like everything
is going my way.

9
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:47,870
Let's study the pronunciation of "on top of
the world". First, let's look at the rhythmic

10
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:55,240
pattern. Which are the content words in this
idiom? Content words are nouns, verbs, adjectives,

11
00:00:55,240 --> 00:01:04,489
and adverbs. In this sentence fragment, that
would be TOP and WORLD. ON, OF, and THE are

12
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:11,750
function words, less important for understanding
the meaning. So TOP and WORLD will be longer,

13
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:21,549
and will have the shape of a stressed syllable:
top, world. ON and OF THE will be quite different,

14
00:01:21,549 --> 00:01:28,619
flatter, lower in pitch. So we have short,
long, short, short, long. da-DA-da-da-DA.

15
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:32,460
On Top of the World. da-DA-da-da-DA.

16
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:38,210
ON begins with the AH as in FATHER vowel.
You need to drop your jaw for that. Then the

17
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:44,969
tongue goes to the roof of the mouth for the
N, on. Luckily that's where it needs to be

18
00:01:44,969 --> 00:01:50,889
for the T consonant. All we have to do is
close the teeth, stop the air, then release

19
00:01:50,889 --> 00:01:59,319
it with the jaw, on to-, to-. Here again we
have the AH as in FATHER vowel. Here it's

20
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:06,259
in a stressed syllable, so it will be longer
and come down in pitch, to-. Then we have

21
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:11,550
the P sound. It's ending the word, and the
next word begins with a vowel, so we want

22
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:20,060
to link this ending consonant to the beginning
vowel. On to-pv. So we're going to link it

23
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:26,640
to the schwa, almost as if it begins the next
word. With OF we have a choice. We can either

24
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:34,310
say the V sound, or drop it. If we drop it,
uh-the, we simply have the schwa, the voiced

25
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:40,920
TH, and the schwa. So to make that TH between
the two sounds, you just need to quickly and

26
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:48,290
lightly bring the tongue tip forward, of the,
of the, of the. Since it's so fast in these

27
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:53,880
unstressed words, you may find that the tongue
tip doesn't push through the teeth much. That's

28
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:59,200
ok, just make sure it's not lifted, at the
roof of the mouth like a D, or pressing down,

29
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:06,410
like for the Z sound. It should just be straight
forward, pressing against the teeth. Uh-the.

30
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:11,970
If you say the V, it's a little more complicated.
The bottom lip comes up and touches the bottom

31
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:23,230
of the top front teeth before the TH. So,
in slow motion, we have of the, of the.

32
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:29,060
And finally we have 'world'. This can be a
really tough word. It has an R sound, and

33
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:36,880
a dark L. Some people have a hard time making
WORLD sound different from WORD. Here's a

34
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:42,180
trick. It's a one-syllable word, but you can
try to make it feel like two syllables. It

35
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:50,010
begins with the W consonant sound, so your
lips need to make a tight circle for that.

36
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:55,960
Then we have the UR as in HER vowel and the
R consonant. The UR vowel isn't separate from

37
00:03:55,960 --> 00:04:02,400
the R consonant. It's just one sound. It's
basically the R consonant acting like a vowel.

38
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:09,010
So don't try to make an extra vowel sound
here, wor-, wor-. The tongue should pull from

39
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:16,070
here, for the W, where the tongue tip is down and
forward, wor-, straight back to the R. The

40
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:22,770
tip shouldn't be touching anything for the
R, and the jaw doesn't need to drop much.

41
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:29,460
Wor-. Now we have the Dark L, which will feel
like another syllable. To make the dark sound,

42
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:34,819
we want to pull the back part of the tongue
back, here. So the tongue goes from this position,

43
00:04:34,819 --> 00:04:39,759
where the middle was raised, to something
flatter as the back part pulls back. Then

44
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:44,310
lift your tongue in the front to the top,
so the flat part is touching the roof of the

45
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:59,499
mouth, dd, dd. This is to make the D sound.
World. The most important thing to practice,

46
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:05,180
to make this word different from WORD, is
pulling back the back part of the tongue for

47
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:14,379
the dark part of the Dark L. Also, don't forget
the shape of a stressed syllable. World. It

48
00:05:14,379 --> 00:05:22,520
should go up in pitch a little at the beginning,
and then down in pitch. World.

49
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:26,319
On top of the world. da-DA-da-da-DA

52
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,789
I can't wait to watch.

That's it, and thanks so much for using Rachel's
English.
