00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:05,099
In this American English pronunciation video,
we're going to talk about places.

2
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:17,050
In this video, we're talking about trips we've
taken recently. Notice how we use phrases

3
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:24,699
like 'for work', 'for fun', 'for school' when
talking about a trip. 'For' is one of those

4
00:00:24,699 --> 00:00:34,230
words that's often reduced (to 'fer'). You'll
also hear several idioms.

5
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:40,719
So Annie is our dear, dear friend visiting
from Denver. Denver. Now, my voice went up,

6
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:46,359
Denver, because I was making a pause but not
done with my thought. But normally, that word

7
00:00:46,359 --> 00:00:53,219
would be said 'Denver'. Stress is on the first
syllable, and the -er ending, unstressed,

8
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:58,409
as always, must be very short: -ver, -ver,
-ver. Denver.

9
00:00:58,409 --> 00:01:03,019
>> Now, where were you before you came here?
>> Um, I was in Boston.

10
00:01:03,019 --> 00:01:08,660
Boston. Another two syllable city name with
stress on the first syllable. So the second

11
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:15,480
syllable, unstressed, must be short to contrast
the length and shape of the first syllable. Boston.

12
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:18,400
>> Annie, now, where were you before you came
here?

13
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,220
>> Um, I was in Boston.
>> For work?

14
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:23,060
>> Yes, indeed.
>> Umm-hmm.

15
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:28,650
>> There was a minor hiccup with a situation
with a badge where I was not allowed access.

16
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:33,240
>> Wait, hold on, I love your use of the word
'hiccup' here. Now, can you explain it? What

17
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:37,530
do you mean by hiccup?
>> Um, there was a situation which was not

18
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:42,670
ideal, it was a bump in the road.
>> Bump in the road. Now that's a---that's

19
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:46,930
also an idiom. Could you explain that?
>> It was really what I would call a hurdle

20
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:50,160
that I had to jump.
>> A hurdle.

21
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:54,660
We're laughing because sometimes it's hard
to explain an idiom without using another

22
00:01:54,660 --> 00:02:01,260
idiom. A hiccup. A bump in the road. A hurdle
to jump. So a hiccup or a bump in the road

23
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:08,149
is something that comes up that was not planned.
So, during her new job orientation, there

24
00:02:08,149 --> 00:02:14,440
was a hiccup. A hurdle to jump, meaning there
were some unforeseen difficulties that she

25
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:18,790
had to deal with. Listen again to this string
of idioms.

26
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:24,480
>> There was a minor hiccup with a situation
with a badge where I was not allowed access.

27
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,620
>> What do you mean by hiccup?
>> Um, there was a situation which was not

28
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:33,750
ideal, it was a bump in the road.
>> Bump in the road. Now that's a---that's

29
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:38,060
also an idiom. Could you explain that?
>> It was really what I would call a hurdle

30
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:41,200
that I had to jump.
>> A hurdle.

31
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,480
>> And you were---you had this hiccup in your
new job orientation.

32
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,850
>> Yes.
>> How excited are you though for your new

33
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:49,290
job?
>> I'm excited. Um, it's a great opportunity,

34
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:55,960
um, just such an amazing experience to meet
some new people. This is all very genuine.

35
00:02:55,960 --> 00:03:00,790
Um, um yeah.
>> I may or may not be putting you on the

36
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:01,959
spot.

37
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:07,819
To be put on the spot, or, to put somebody
on the spot. This is an idiom that means to

38
00:03:07,819 --> 00:03:13,340
ask somebody to do something or make a decision
without preparation, and maybe in front of

39
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:18,270
other people. In this case, I'm putting Annie
on the spot because I'm asking her to talk

40
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:24,319
about something in front of the video camera
with no preparation. Here the T in 'put' is

41
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:30,819
a flap T, or a D sound, because it comes between
two vowels when we link the words together. 

42
00:03:30,819 --> 00:03:32,120
Put on the spot.

43
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:36,270
>> Putting you on the spot. Could you explain
that idiom?

44
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:42,349
>> Um, that means that you are the focal point.
You are really---there is a certain amount

45
00:03:42,349 --> 00:03:44,170
of pressure.
>> And there was no preparation, maybe.

46
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:47,480
>> Hot seat. Hot seat. No preparation. It's
spontaneous, it's, um...

47
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:50,120
>> You didn't know you were going to be asked
to speak.

48
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,849
>> Yes.
>> Now, the other idiom you came up with

49
00:03:52,849 --> 00:03:54,680
was 'hot seat'.
>> Yes it was.

50
00:03:54,680 --> 00:04:01,069
>> Can you make up a sentence with 'hot seat'?
>> Man. I hate being in the hot seat when

51
00:04:01,069 --> 00:04:04,629
topic turns to something I am not quite comfortable
answering.

52
00:04:04,629 --> 00:04:09,290
>> Yeah. Shall I take you off the hot seat?
>> Please do, Rachel.

53
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:12,560
>> Now Katherine, you were saying earlier
that you've been on a trip recently.

54
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,930
>> Yes, I went to Baltimore.
>> I thought you went to DC?

55
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:17,430
>> I went to DC too.

56
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:23,860
Two more place names. Baltimore. Stress is
on the first syllable, so that should be the

57
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:29,680
longest. After the stressed syllable, the
voice will come down in volume and pitch.

58
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:37,529
So the last syllable: -more, -more, -more,
will be quick, low in pitch, and low in volume.

59
00:04:37,529 --> 00:04:43,550
Baltimore. With DC, it's just the opposite. 
Stress is on the last syllable. 

60
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:44,550
Any time you're naming

61
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:54,870
something by a list of letters, like DC or
HBO or MLK, stress is always on the last letter.

62
00:04:54,870 --> 00:05:02,049
So that letter will be the longest and have
the most shape. DC, C, DC.

63
00:05:02,049 --> 00:05:05,320
>> So, tell me a little bit about that trip.
>> To DC?

64
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:10,210
>> Well, either one.
>> Um, well, I went to a college in DC. Um,

65
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:18,070
and I looked at a fashion show, and looked
at portfolios, and ... um...

66
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:20,119
>> So this was for work.
>> This was for work.

67
00:05:20,119 --> 00:05:22,530
>> Well thanks for telling me about your trips
to Baltimore and DC.

68
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:26,819
>> We were just talking, I went to India.
>> Oh you did? Recently?

69
00:05:26,819 --> 00:05:30,300
>> About four years ago.
>> Was that for work or for fun?

70
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,959
>> For fun.
>> What did you do there?

71
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:37,759
>> I studied Buddhism and Tibetan community
politics.

72
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:43,039
>> That sounds like it's for school.
>> It was for school, but it was, ah, I took

73
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,740
a semester off from college to go.

74
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:48,129
>> Renee, and, I hear that you took a trip
last weekend.

75
00:05:48,129 --> 00:05:49,479
>> I did.
>> Where did you go?

76
00:05:49,479 --> 00:05:51,779
>> I went to upstate New York.
>> Nice.

77
00:05:51,779 --> 00:05:56,819
>> Town called Hudson, on the Hudson River.
It was actually---are you interested in why

78
00:05:56,819 --> 00:05:58,819
it was founded?
>> Yes.

79
00:05:58,819 --> 00:06:05,419
>> It was founded by whalers who originally
whaled in Nantucket. But they decided to move

80
00:06:05,419 --> 00:06:09,149
their families up the Hudson River to another
place that would still be on the water.

81
00:06:09,149 --> 00:06:11,319
>> Why did they want to move their families
away from Nantucket?

82
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:14,519
>> I don't remember that part of the story.

83
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:19,889
>> Sara, where were you last weekend?
>> I went to visit my sister's family in Virginia.

84
00:06:19,889 --> 00:06:24,110
>> Virginia. That's a fun state name.
>> It's a great state.

85
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:26,830
>> Where did you go?
>> I went to Florida.

86
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:29,689
>> Florida. Is that where you're from?
>> That's where I'm from!

87
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:32,089
>> I know, but you're from further north,
and I'm from further south.

88
00:06:32,089 --> 00:06:36,849
>> I know. What did you do there?
>> Spend time with my family at my parent's

89
00:06:36,849 --> 00:06:42,969
house. Went in the pool. I went to the beach
a bit, walked at sunset. And that's about it.

90
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:47,089
>> That sounds lovely. Guys, thank you, everybody,

91
00:06:47,089 --> 00:06:50,499
for telling me about the places that you've
recently been.

92
00:06:50,499 --> 00:06:53,489
>> Absolutely.
>> Oh, we were so happy to share.

93
00:06:53,489 --> 00:06:55,699
>> Really appreciate it.

94
00:06:55,699 --> 00:06:58,189
>> Katherine.
>> Yes?

95
00:06:58,189 --> 00:07:03,919
>> If you were going to work on your American
English pronunciation---let's say you already

96
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:08,409
know some of the concepts, you've seen some
videos, but you want to really work it, to

97
00:07:08,409 --> 00:07:13,339
get it into your habit. What would you do
to do that?

98
00:07:13,339 --> 00:07:16,699
>> I would take the Rachel's English video
class.

99
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:23,699
>> Do you mean the Rachel's English online
course in July and August?

100
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:32,050
>> I'd take the Rachel's English ...
>> Ok, who can keep a straight face in here?

101
00:07:32,729 --> 00:07:36,710
Because she can't, and she can't.

102
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:42,219
To keep a straight face is to be able to do
something without laughing. Something my friends

103
00:07:42,219 --> 00:07:48,849
clearly have a difficult time doing, which
is why we have so much fun together. Take

104
00:07:48,849 --> 00:07:50,459
two.

105
00:07:50,459 --> 00:07:53,699
>> Katherine.
>> Yes.

106
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:58,599
>> If you felt like you wanted to work on
your American English pronunciation this summer,

107
00:07:58,599 --> 00:08:01,979
what would you do?
>> I would take the Rachel's English course

108
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:06,569
in July and August.
>> That sounds like a very smart woman. If

109
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:13,029
you didn't know, I am giving an online course
in July and August of 2012. Check out my website

110
00:08:13,029 --> 00:08:14,860
for more details.

111
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:19,729
That's it, and thanks so much for using Rachel's
English.

112
00:08:19,729 --> 00:08:25,419
Don't stop there. Have fun with my real-life
English videos. Or get more comfortable with
