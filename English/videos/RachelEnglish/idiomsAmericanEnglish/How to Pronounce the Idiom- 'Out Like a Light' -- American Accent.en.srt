Today I'm going to go over the idiom 'out
like a light'. I can mean two different things.

2
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:17,710
It can mean in a very deep sleep, or it can
mean unconscious. I actually found myself

3
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:22,770
using this the other day describing how well
I was sleeping. I didn't hear the sirens last

4
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:28,780
night, I was out like a light. However, I've
also used it before for having been unconscious.

5
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:34,110
I was chopping vegetables one day not too
long ago and I cut off the very end of my

6
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:39,839
thumb. And I ended up at the ER. And when
they took the bandage off of my thumb, I immediately

7
00:00:39,839 --> 00:00:47,690
passed out. I was out like a light. This phrase
begins with the 'ow' as in 'now' diphthong,

8
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:56,019
ow, ow, and it then has the T. It's a final
T, so you might hear it as a stop T, out,

9
00:00:56,019 --> 00:01:03,830
out, or you might hear it lightly released,
out, out. Like, the L consonant sound and

10
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:14,110
the 'ai' as in 'buy' diphthong. Out li-, out
li-, kk. The K consonant sound -- out like,

11
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:25,220
out like, a. The schwa. Out like a. Out like
a. And finally, light, the L consonant sound,

12
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:31,210
the 'ai' as in 'buy' diphthong, and again
a final T. So, it might be stopped, or it

13
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:39,460
might be released. Light or light. You'll
notice the words 'out' and 'light' are the

14
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:46,000
stressed words here. Out like a light. Out
like a light. I was out like a light.
