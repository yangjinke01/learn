00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:07,590
In this American English pronunciation video,
we're going to go over a few idioms.

2
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:19,949
Today is October 31st. That's Halloween. A
couple of years ago I made a video on how

3
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:25,109
to pronounce Halloween, and showed some scenes
from a Halloween party, and all of my friends

4
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:31,830
in costume. In the US, Halloween is a holiday
in which little kids dress up in costumes

5
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:38,360
and go around, house to house, and say 'trick
or treat', in order to get candy. Trick or

6
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:44,610
treat. Are you noticing how I'm reducing the
word 'or' there, to just the schwa-R sound?

7
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:52,170
Rr, rr, rr. Trick or, trick or. Now, I've
already made a video on how to reduce the

8
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:58,489
word 'or', I to suggest you take a look at
it. Trick or treat. Trick or treat.

9
00:00:58,489 --> 00:01:04,619
But sometimes, even adults will dress up in
costume. Now, I find this a little odd. I'm

10
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:09,279
not quite sure why an adult would want to
dress up to look like a scary person or a

11
00:01:09,279 --> 00:01:14,729
dead person. I, personally, never do it. Now,
my friends are having a Halloween party this

12
00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:19,439
year, and I told them I was not going to dress
up because I just think it's silly. And they

13
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:26,060
said, "Rachel, don't be a party pooper". So
let's go over that idiom, party pooper. First,

14
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:30,990
note that the T in 'party' is a Flap T. Now,
you know that because it comes after an R

15
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:38,969
consonant and before a vowel. Party, party.
Pooper. This is a two-syllable word, stress

16
00:01:38,969 --> 00:01:46,229
is on the first syllable. It begins with the
P consonant, the 'oo' vowel: poo-, poo-. Now,

17
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:53,319
since that's the stressed syllable, make sure
it has some shape in it, poo-, poo-. The second,

18
00:01:53,319 --> 00:02:00,809
unstressed syllable is the P consonant, and
then schwa-R sound, -per, -per, -per. Now

19
00:02:00,809 --> 00:02:06,630
that's going to be flat and lower in pitch
because it's unstressed. Party pooper, party

20
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:12,969
pooper. So, what is a party pooper? A party
pooper is someone who spoils other people's

21
00:02:12,969 --> 00:02:19,159
fun by not participating, or by saying, "Oh,
that's stupid, that's a dumb idea." So basically,

22
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:22,790
that's me, because I'm going to a costume
party, and I'm not going to dress up. Because

23
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:25,909
I just think dressing up is silly.

24
00:02:25,909 --> 00:02:32,310
Another idiom that has a similar meaning is
wet blanket. So this, again, is someone who

25
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:37,349
will spoil other people's enjoyment by not
participating in general, withdrawing a little

26
00:02:37,349 --> 00:02:43,810
bit. For example: Mary had a great party last
night, but her new roommate is sort of a wet

27
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:48,900
blanket. Meaning, maybe she didn't participate,
she sat in the corner, wouldn't talk to anybody,

28
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:53,689
or maybe even just stayed in her room. So,
let's go over the pronunciation. It begins

29
00:02:53,689 --> 00:03:00,510
with the W consonant sound, where the lips
will be in a very tight circle. Then, the

30
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:08,439
EH as in BED vowel, we-, we-. The final T
here is a stop consonant. Usually final T's,

31
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:13,310
are, unless the next word begins with a vowel.
We don't have that here. So, it's going to

32
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:19,390
be a stop. Wet blanket. What does that mean?
That means I put my tongue up into position

33
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:26,939
for the T, wet, wet, but I don't release the
sound. I just go into the next word. Here,

34
00:03:26,939 --> 00:03:33,719
the next word begins with the BL consonant
cluster. Wet bl-. Make sure your tongue tip

35
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:40,049
is up here for the L. Bl-, bl-. That's how
you know you're making that sound correctly.

36
00:03:40,049 --> 00:03:46,249
Bl-, bl-, wet bl-. Now, the next sound. If
you look it up in the dictionary, it will

37
00:03:46,249 --> 00:03:51,889
say it is the AA as in BAT vowel. But as you
know, when the AA vowel is followed by the

38
00:03:51,889 --> 00:03:58,340
nasal consonant NG, it's not really the AA
vowel. It's much more like the AY as in SAY

39
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:07,829
diphthong. Bla-, bla-, blan-. Then the tongue
comes up back here to touch for the NG sound,

40
00:04:07,829 --> 00:04:16,680
right where it needs to be for the K, so it
just simply pulls away there to release. Blank-,

41
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:25,280
blank-. And finally, the schwa-T sound in
the unstressed syllable. Blanket, blanket.

42
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:30,120
Notice I'm not releasing the T at the end
of 'blanket'. Again, I'm making it a stop

43
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:34,340
T. Blanket. Wet blanket.

44
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:40,090
And one last idiom with a similar meaning,
stick in the mud. Again, this is someone who

45
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:45,580
spoils the fun by not participating. Rachel,
why don't you dress up for the Halloween party?

46
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:52,090
It's a costume party. Well. Because I'm a
stick in the mud. So how do you pronounce

47
00:04:52,090 --> 00:05:00,199
this? It begins with the ST consonant cluster,
opens into the IH as in SIT vowel. Sti-, sti-.

48
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:05,449
Now, the next word begins with a vowel. So
the ending consonant here in the word 'stick'

49
00:05:05,449 --> 00:05:13,810
will link into that. Stick in, stick in, stick
in. That will help us to connect the words

50
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:20,660
and make them very smooth. Stick in, stick
in. The next word, the, has the TH sound and

51
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:26,129
the schwa. Now, it's unstressed. So, along
with 'in', it's going to be low in pitch and

52
00:05:26,129 --> 00:05:33,849
flat, in the, in the, in the. And finally,
the word 'mud'. M consonant, UH as in BUTTER,

53
00:05:33,849 --> 00:05:38,940
and the D sound. Stick in the mud, stick in
the mud.

54
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:43,660
So, even though I won't be dressing up this
Halloween, I'm still going to have fun. And

55
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:50,660
I hope you will to. That's it, and thanks
so much for using Rachel's English.
