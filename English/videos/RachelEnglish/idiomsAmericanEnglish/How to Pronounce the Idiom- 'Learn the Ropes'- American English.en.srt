Today I'm going to go over the pronunciation
of the idiom "learn the ropes." First, the

2
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:18,470
meaning. This means to understand how to do
something. Learn the ropes. So let's look

3
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:24,720
at some example sentences. It's ok to ask
questions while you're learning the ropes.

4
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:31,720
Or, After I learn the ropes, I'l be able to
do it on my own. Learn begins with the L consonant

5
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:38,750
sound, ll. It then has the 'ur' as in 'her'
vowel / R consonant sound together: rr, rr,

6
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:46,470
rr, lear-. So your tongue will go from being
at the very top, forward part of the roof

7
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:53,470
of the mouth, lear-, rr, to being pulled back,
raised in the middle, pressing against the

8
00:00:53,470 --> 00:01:00,829
insides of the top teeth with the tip then
hanging down, lear-, further back in the mouth.

9
00:01:00,829 --> 00:01:07,060
Learn. Then the N consonant sound, so the
tongue, doing acrobatics here, then has to

10
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:14,060
go back up to the roof of the mouth, learn,
to make that N sound. Learn. The: the TH consonant

11
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:25,390
sound, voiced, with the schwa, learn the,
learn the. It's an unaccented word. Ropes

12
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:30,460
begins with the R consonant sound at the beginning
of the word. The lip position will be quite

13
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:37,460
tight, rr, rr. The tongue in that same R position.
Ro-, the 'oh' as in 'no' diphthong, ro-pp.

14
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:48,450
The P sound, so the lips have to come together,
pp, to release that, and finally, the S sound.

15
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:55,500
Both the P and the S are unvoiced. Ropes,
ppss, ppss. Learn the ropes. That's it, and

16
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:00,990
thanks so much for using Rachel's English.
