Today I'm going to go over the idiom 'on fire'.
This means to be doing something very well.

2
00:00:13,539 --> 00:00:18,250
For example, you're at a basketball game,
and there's a guy who keeps hitting 3-pointer

3
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:24,309
after 3-pointer after 3-pointer, and making
them. You might say, man that guy's on fire.

4
00:00:24,309 --> 00:00:29,329
It can also apply to a social situation. For
example, let's say you go to a party with

5
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:34,430
a friend. And your friend is talking to everyone,
making everyone laugh, everyone wants to be

6
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:40,300
around him. You can say, 'Man, you were on
fire at that party.' On can be pronounced

7
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:45,090
with the 'aw' as in 'law' vowel, or the 'ah'
as in 'father' vowel. I pronounce it with

8
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:49,079
the 'aw' as in 'law'. It's a little further
back in the face than the 'ah' as in 'father',

9
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:54,400
which is a little further forward. On, the
N consonant sound, so the tongue will raise

10
00:00:54,400 --> 00:01:00,989
into that position. On, ff, fire begins with
the F consonant sound, so you'll raise the

11
00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:07,989
bottom lip, ff, to the top teeth and let air
come through. On ff, on fi-, the 'ai' as in

12
00:01:07,989 --> 00:01:24,649
'buy' diphthong, on fi-re. And finally, the
schwa and R sound, er, er. On fire, on fire.
