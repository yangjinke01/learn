00:00:06,698 --> 00:00:11,989
Today I’m going to go over the pronunciation
for the idiom to bend over backwards.

2
00:00:11,989 --> 00:00:17,458
This means to do as much as you possibly
can to get your desired results.

3
00:00:17,458 --> 00:00:20,577
Perhaps more than what
would be expected.

4
00:00:20,602 --> 00:00:24,944
For example, let’s say I’m trying to
hire a new person to come to my firm

5
00:00:24,944 --> 00:00:29,300
and I’ll do whatever it takes
to get him or her to commit.

6
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:33,371
I might say, I’ll bend over
backwards to get you here.

7
00:00:33,371 --> 00:00:37,597
Or, for example, let’s say my mother
in law was visiting last weekend.

8
00:00:37,622 --> 00:00:41,360
I might say, I bent over
backwards to make her happy.

9
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,932
It begins with the B consonant sound.

10
00:00:43,932 --> 00:00:48,858
That is voiced, bb, so your
vocal cords are making noise.

11
00:00:48,858 --> 00:00:53,711
Then the ‘eh’ as in ‘bed’
vowel sound: be- be-.

12
00:00:53,736 --> 00:00:57,548
Nn, tongue moves up into
position for the N.

13
00:00:57,548 --> 00:00:59,820
Ben-d.

14
00:00:59,845 --> 00:01:03,319
Here you would either have the
D or the T consonant sound,

15
00:01:03,319 --> 00:01:07,706
depending on if you’re speaking
present/future, or past.

16
00:01:07,706 --> 00:01:10,227
Bend/bent.

17
00:01:10,227 --> 00:01:14,549
Over begins with the ‘oh’
as in ‘no’ diphthong.

18
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:20,079
O – vv, vv, then the V consonant
sound, where the bottom lip raises

19
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:24,223
to lightly touch the bottom
of the top front teeth.

20
00:01:24,223 --> 00:01:28,709
Ov, vv, and you make a sound
with the vocal cords.

21
00:01:28,734 --> 00:01:29,985
Over.

22
00:01:29,985 --> 00:01:37,028
You then have the schwa sound, unaccented,
with the R consonant sound, over.

23
00:01:37,053 --> 00:01:44,712
Backwards begins, again, with the B sound,
bb, then the ‘aa’ as in ‘bat’ vowel.

24
00:01:44,712 --> 00:01:47,536
Ba-, ba- kk.

25
00:01:47,536 --> 00:01:50,319
The K consonant sound,
where the tongue goes up

26
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:54,893
and touches in the back, kk,
releasing to make that sound.

27
00:01:54,893 --> 00:01:58,631
Back, back, -wards.

28
00:01:58,631 --> 00:02:05,117
The W consonant sound, where the
lips form a tight circle, www,

29
00:02:05,117 --> 00:02:11,900
and the schwa sound with the R
consonant sound war-, war- ds.

30
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:19,440
The D consonant sound followed by the Z
consonant sound, both voiced: dz, dz.

31
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,252
Backwards.

32
00:02:21,252 --> 00:02:24,118
To bend over backwards.
