00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,970
In this American English pronunciation video,
we're going to go over the idiom 'taken to

2
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:05,970
the cleaners'.

3
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:17,400
To be taken to the cleaners can mean the same
thing as the idiom 'ripped off', which we've

4
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:23,109
already studied: They charged me double, I
was taken to the cleaners. But it can also

5
00:00:23,109 --> 00:00:29,300
mean to be bested by someone, to be defeated.
For example, my team was taken to the cleaners

6
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:34,340
in the last game of the season. That doesn't
mean that we lost by one or two points. That

7
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:37,680
means we lost by a lot.

8
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,239
Taken to the cleaners begins with the True
T, your teeth have to come together, your

9
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:49,570
tongue has to go to the roof of the mouth,
tt. Then we have the AY as in SAY diphthong.

10
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:56,770
Common problem is not dropping the jaw enough
for the first sound. Ta-. This is a stressed

11
00:00:56,770 --> 00:01:04,870
syllable. The second syllable is unstressed.
Ta-ken, -ken, -ken. Super fast -- so it's

12
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:10,440
the K, schwa/N sound. For the K sound, the
back part of the tongue comes up and touches

13
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:15,970
the soft palate here, the tongue tip stays
down. Then you quickly release the K and the

14
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:21,550
front part of the tongue goes to the roof
of the mouth for the N, -ken. You don't need

15
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:27,720
to worry about making a separate schwa vowel
sound, enough of one will happen as you transition.

16
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:34,900
Now we have TO and THE, both unstressed in
this sentence fragment. I'm going to reduce

17
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:41,060
the vowel to the schwa in TO, and I'm even
going to reduce the T to a Flap T instead

18
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:47,330
of a True T. So, it's going to sound like
'de' instead of 'te'. I'm going to link it

19
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:53,510
to the word THE. The two words link together
and they're going to be very flat and quick,

20
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:59,790
'to the', 'to the'. Actually, I've made a
video on these two words specifically, how

21
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:07,170
the mouth moves to make these two words together,
so check that out. To the, to the, to the.

22
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:13,520
Not clear on its own, right? Taken to the,
taken to the. Taken to the cleaners. Cleaners,

23
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:20,980
a noun, a content word, is stressed. It has
two syllables, and just like 'taken', stress

24
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:29,170
is on the first syllable.
Cleaners. 'Cleaners' begins with the KL consonant

25
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:34,110
cluster. So the back part of the tongue lifts
and touches the soft palate here. But this

26
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:38,560
time, rather than the tongue tip being down,
the tongue tip can be in position for the

27
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:46,830
L, here. That way when you release the K,
you're ready to go for the L, kl, kl, kl.

28
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:53,680
Next, the EE as in SHE vowel -- tongue tip
down, cl-, cl-, but front part of the tongue

29
00:02:53,680 --> 00:03:00,200
very close to the roof of the mouth, clea-.
Corners of the lips may pull back a little

30
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:08,790
bit, clea-. And the last syllable, unstressed,
quite fast, -ners, -ners, -ners. Tongue tip

31
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:15,720
will be up here at the roof of the mouth for
the N, clean, and then pull back for

32
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:22,720
the R, cleaner-. Again, you don't need to
think about making a schwa sound between the

33
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:30,350
two. The schwa is sort of absorbed by the
R anyway. And the S is pronounced as a Z,

34
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:36,180
-ners, -ners, -ners. Cleaners, taken to the
cleaners.

35
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:41,240
Practice your English: Make up a sentence
that uses this idiom, record a video, and

36
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:46,040
post it as a video response to this video
on YouTube. I can't wait to watch!

37
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:50,040
That's it, and thanks so much for using Rachel's
English.
