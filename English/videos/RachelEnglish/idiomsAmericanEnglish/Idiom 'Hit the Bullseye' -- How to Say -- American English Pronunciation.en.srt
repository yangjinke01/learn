00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:05,640
In this American English pronunciation video,
we're going to go over the idiom 'hit the

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:06,710
bullseye'.

3
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:15,610
>> Let me try one more time.
>> You aren't actually trying. Please tell

4
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:19,980
me...
>> Hold on, hold on.

5
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:27,430
>> Triple 7. Double 7. Double 7.

6
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:31,800
>> Folks, that's how it's done.

7
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:43,630
In the mean time, let me just quickly tell
the users out there how to pronounce 'bullseye'.

8
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:48,059
Because that it what this video is about.
It's a two-syllable phrase with stress on

9
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:55,020
the first syllable. DA-da. Bullseye. So we
begin with the B consonant sound, lips are

10
00:00:55,020 --> 00:01:00,219
together. Then we have the UH as in PULL vowel,
but because it's followed by a Dark L, it's

11
00:01:00,219 --> 00:01:06,400
really just a dark sound. Bull-, uhl. So I'm
pulling the back part of the tongue back, while

12
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:12,360
the tip of the tongue stays forward. Bulls-.
Now, I don't bring my tongue tip up. I just

13
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:19,360
go straight into the Z. So my teeth close,
my tongue tip stays where it is, bullseye.

14
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:25,100
Then I have the AI as in BUY diphthong. Jaw
does need to drop for the first half of that

15
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:32,100
diphthong. Ai, ii, and then my jaw drops less
as the tongue lifts up towards the roof of

16
00:01:32,119 --> 00:01:38,270
the mouth for the second half of the diphthong.
Bullseye, DA-da. Make sure you get the rhythm

17
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:45,270
in there. The rhythm is really important.
We want long, then short. DA-da. Bullseye.

18
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:51,990
To hit the bullseye literally means to hit
the center of a target, something I'm clearly

19
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:58,990
not able to do. Figuratively, it means to
do something just right, to get the best result

20
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:06,450
possible, to be exactly right. Hit the bullseye.
Notice we have a Stop T in the word 'hit'.

21
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:12,099
That's because the next word begins with a
consonant. Also, notice how it's stressed.

22
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:18,650
It's louder, higher in pitch than the next
word, the, which is unstressed. Hit the. Hit

23
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:25,579
the. You can simplify things here by making
a Stop T. First, make the H consonant and

24
00:02:25,579 --> 00:02:32,579
the IH as in SIT vowel. Hi-, hi-. Then, put
your tongue into position for the TH, with

25
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:38,150
the tip coming just through the teeth. As you
do this, stop the air quickly in the throat

26
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:46,040
to make the stop. Then, you're already in
the right position for the TH. Hit the [3x].

27
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,169
Hit the bullseye.

28
00:02:48,169 --> 00:02:54,129
To hit the bullseye, is also like to hit the
nail on the head, another idiom, which basically

29
00:02:54,129 --> 00:02:59,760
means, that's exactly right. So, for example,
I might say, 'I'm not feeling well, I'm not

30
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,049
really sure...' And a friend who knows me
may say, 'You know what, you're not happy

31
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:07,969
at work.' And I'm thinking, 'You know what?
That's right.' And I say, 'You hit the bullseye.

32
00:03:07,969 --> 00:03:15,969
You hit the nail on the head.' Now, I'm going
to try to hit a bullseye. So, cheer me on.

33
00:03:15,969 --> 00:03:22,989
Let's hear it.
>> Rachel, Rachel.

34
00:03:29,399 --> 00:03:32,039
>> This is a difficult game.
>> Yeah.

35
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:37,819
>> Probably, the chances are, at least one
of my fans is a dart expert.

36
00:03:37,819 --> 00:03:41,279
>> Amen.
>> So, I'm going to say, please put in the

37
00:03:41,279 --> 00:03:47,299
comments below any tips you have. Anything
you see about my form that should be corrected.

38
00:03:47,299 --> 00:03:48,280
>> That's smart.

39
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:52,909
>> Tom, what did the dart board just say?
>> It said, 'Remove darts'.

40
00:03:52,909 --> 00:03:59,909
>> So, dart. Can you hold up the dart? This
is a dart as a noun. But it's also a verb.

41
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,339
>> That's true.

42
00:04:01,339 --> 00:04:07,529
The verb 'to dart' means to move quickly.
A mouse might dart across the floor, or your

43
00:04:07,529 --> 00:04:14,129
eyes might dart in the direction of a sudden
sound. This word has the AH + R combination,

44
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:18,859
which can be a challenge for some speakers.
You want to make sure that you drop your jaw

45
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:26,310
with the tongue forward: da-, dar-, before
you pull your tongue back for the R, so you

46
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:36,370
can get a good vowel sound. Dart, dart. Remember,
if you want to link the word 'dart' into a

47
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:45,050
word that begins with a vowel, make the T
a flap T. For example, dart around. Dart a-,

48
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:49,300
dart a-, dart around.

49
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:54,300
>> That's it, and thanks so much for using
Rachel's English.
