00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:06,790
In this American English pronunciation video,
we're going to ride our bikes into Brooklyn

2
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:11,950
to make some pizza. And of course, you'll
learn some American English pronunciation

3
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:18,950
on the way, including the idioms to catch
up and to fill in. Oh boy!

4
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:33,559
This is my bicycle, Jenny. I didn't name her,
she came named. Tonight we're going to go

5
00:00:33,559 --> 00:00:39,729
for a bike ride into Brooklyn. Brooklyn is
the borough just east of Manhattan (one of

6
00:00:39,729 --> 00:00:45,299
the boroughs just east of Manhattan). So let's
look at Brooklyn. It has two O's. Now, there

7
00:00:45,299 --> 00:00:59,860
are four different ways to pronounce two O's:
oo, as in boo, uh as in book, uh as in blood,

8
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:07,900
and oh as in brooch. So how is it pronounced
in Brooklyn? Uh, uh, Brooklyn. What's your

9
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:18,340
guess? The answer is: it's the same as the
vowel in 'book'. Brooklyn. Now. Let's get

10
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:20,790
going before it gets dark.

11
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:28,080
It's about a 45-minute bike ride from my home
in Manhattan to my friend's home in Brooklyn.

12
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:33,450
It involves taking the Manhattan bridge over
the East River.

13
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:35,550
>> Hey.

14
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:47,810
It's seven o'clock on the nose, seven o'clock
sharp. Those idioms mean, of course, exactly

15
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:57,300
seven o'clock. We're right on time. We're very
punctual. Punk - chew - ul. Let's go Sara.

16
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:05,050
>> So we rode our bikes in from Brooklyn.
>> No! In from Manhattan!

17
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:12,039
>> We rode our bikes from Manhattan into Brooklyn
--- because it's been a while since we've

18
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:16,000
seen each other. So we're making some dinner,
we're making pizza, and we're going to catch up.

19
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:17,000
>> We're going to catch up. [2x]
>> Find out what's going on in each other's lives.

20
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,560
>> That's right. Catch up. An idiom that you

21
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,010
would use if you haven't seen somebody in
a while, and you want to know what's going

22
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:33,569
on. You would say, "let's catch up". You could
also say, "fill me in". What else could you

23
00:02:33,569 --> 00:02:40,260
say? Ketchup, by the way, spelled this way,
is also a condiment.

24
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:45,260
>> This girl can cook. You remember -- from
the turkey.

25
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:55,420
Cook. Does that 'uh' sound sound familiar?
It's the same sound as in 'book' and 'Brooklyn'.

26
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:56,060
Listen again.

27
00:02:56,060 --> 00:03:00,480
>> This girl can cook. You remember -- from
the turkey.

28
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:06,340
>> Oh boy.
>> Oh boy. I like that phrase.

29
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:08,890
>> Oh boy?
>> It's a good one. What, do you say that

30
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:12,989
when you're exasperated? Oh boy.
>> Overwhelmed, like when you're overwhelmed?

31
00:03:12,989 --> 00:03:16,530
>> It's a good one. Oh boy.
>> Or excited.

32
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,269
>> Or excited. Oh boy!

33
00:03:18,269 --> 00:03:25,269
>> Is this done Beads? I don't know?
>> Yeah, no, I mean, yeah, I think, well.

34
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:30,330
The first pie always takes longer because
of the oven.

35
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:37,900
Did you hear how I said 'cuz of the oven'?
Cuzof, cuzof, cuzof. If I said that out of

36
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:42,890
the context of a sentence, nobody would know
what I was talking about. But as a part of

37
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:49,650
the whole, that's they way it makes sense
to say it. Cuzof. We reduce it, it's low in

38
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:56,450
pitch, cuzofthe, cuzofthe, cuzofthe oven.
Then the 'oven' is the stressed word. So,

39
00:03:56,450 --> 00:04:01,980
this is very important in English: that the
function words, the less important words,

40
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:07,800
are low in pitch, strung together, maybe reduced,
to contrast with the shape of the stressed

41
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,900
word: cuzofthe oven.

42
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:12,020
>> So, when it's pretty much cooked. Actually,
when it's cooked.

43
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:17,069
>> Hold on, did you, did you guys notice,
she just said 'pretty', with a flap T. Can

44
00:04:17,069 --> 00:04:18,639
you say that again?
>> What? It's pretty much?

45
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:21,779
>> Yeah, but say it at the camera!
>> Pretty much.

46
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:24,199
>> Thank you for the demonstration.
>> You're welcome!

47
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:27,559
>> Ok, when it's pretty much cooked?
>> When it's pretty much cooked, we're going

48
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:34,699
to bring it out, and we're going to put arugula---
>> Hold on. Did you notice? She's using 'gonna'.

49
00:04:34,699 --> 00:04:37,830
We're gonna bring it out, we're gonna put
arugula.

50
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:42,520
>> Yes, we're going to put arugula, and we're
going to put prosciutto, and we're going to

51
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:45,229
crumble some more blue cheese and we're going
to drizzle it with honey.

52
00:04:45,229 --> 00:04:51,559
>> Wow, that sounds amazing, and it was such
a good demonstration of using 'gonna'. Thank

53
00:04:51,559 --> 00:04:55,269
you.
>> You're welcome.

54
00:04:55,269 --> 00:05:02,239
>> This looks pretty good. Pretty good.
>> Pretty: flap T!

55
00:05:02,239 --> 00:05:09,239
>> Ok. Let's slice this baby up.

56
00:05:09,599 --> 00:05:16,599
>> My favorite topping: pepperoni. I like
it almost as much as I like buying shoes.

57
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:26,300
Then we made a second pizza, totally different
from the first, and sat down to a nice meal.

58
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:30,479
After the lovely evening, it was time to say
good-bye.

59
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,219
>> Bye! Thank you so much!
>> Bye! You're welcome.

60
00:05:33,219 --> 00:05:36,669
>> It was good to see you, it was so good
to catch up!

61
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:39,729
>> It was good to catch up.

62
00:05:39,729 --> 00:05:44,979
That's it, and thanks so much
for using Rachel's English.
