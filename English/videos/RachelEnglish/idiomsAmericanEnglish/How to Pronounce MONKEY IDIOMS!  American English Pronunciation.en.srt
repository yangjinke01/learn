00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:06,515
In this American English pronunciation video,
we're going to monkey around.

2
00:00:06,516 --> 00:00:09,488
Just kidding.  That means to waste time.

3
00:00:09,489 --> 00:00:14,170
We're not going to waste time.
We're going to learn monkey idioms!

4
00:00:14,171 --> 00:00:21,489
 

5
00:00:21,505 --> 00:00:26,029
To begin, let's go over the
pronunciation of the word 'monkey'.

6
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:32,583
This is a two-syllable word with stress
on the first syllable. DA-da, monkey.

7
00:00:32,584 --> 00:00:38,998
It begins with the M consonant sound,
where the lips come together. MMmmmo-.

8
00:00:38,999 --> 00:00:44,406
Then we have the UH as in BUTTER sound.
This is a completely relaxed sound.

9
00:00:44,407 --> 00:00:49,274
So, your tongue should be forward and
relaxed, uh, uh, a little bit of jaw drop,

10
00:00:49,275 --> 00:00:53,235
and your lips should be completely relaxed.
MMmmmo-.

11
00:00:53,236 --> 00:00:55,302
Because this is a stressed syllable,

12
00:00:55,303 --> 00:01:03,672
it should have the up-down shape of a
stressed syllable in the voice. Mo-, mon-.

13
00:01:03,673 --> 00:01:05,999
Now we have the NG sound.

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,614
The reason why the letter N
is representing the NG sound

15
00:01:09,615 --> 00:01:13,333
is because the next sound is the K,
and they're made in the same spot.

16
00:01:13,334 --> 00:01:18,127
So, to make the NG sound, the tongue tip is
here, touching behind the bottom front teeth,

17
00:01:18,128 --> 00:01:21,739
and the back part of the tongue reaches
up and touches the soft palate.

18
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:28,374
The soft palate is lowered here because
it's a nasal consonant, ng, ng-k.

19
00:01:28,375 --> 00:01:31,532
Then, to make the K, you just
release the tongue down,

20
00:01:31,533 --> 00:01:35,197
monk-, -k-.

21
00:01:35,198 --> 00:01:41,619
The soft palate will close for that. Then
we go into the EE as in SHE vowel. Monkey.

22
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:45,959
Since it's in an unstressed syllable,
it should be very short and low in pitch,

23
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,697
-key, -key, -key. Monkey.

24
00:01:49,698 --> 00:01:54,676
Let's get into some idioms.
First, 'fun as a barrel of monkeys'.

25
00:01:54,677 --> 00:01:58,751
This means something that's really fun,
kind of like this video.

26
00:01:58,752 --> 00:02:00,828
But I usually use it sarcastically,

27
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:04,201
which means that I am explaining
something that is not at all fun.

28
00:02:04,202 --> 00:02:10,453
For example, I'm going to the dentist to have
a cavity filled. Fun as a barrel of monkeys.

29
00:02:10,454 --> 00:02:16,451
The stress pattern for this phrase is
DA-da-da-DA-da. Barrel of monkeys.

30
00:02:16,452 --> 00:02:19,047
So, in many cases we'll reduce the word 'of'

31
00:02:19,048 --> 00:02:26,967
to just have the schwa sound, no consonant 
at all. Barrel of, DA-da-da, Barrel of.

32
00:02:26,968 --> 00:02:32,866
Barrel of monkeys. Now here we're making
'monkey' plural, so the S will be a Z sound,

33
00:02:32,867 --> 00:02:39,551
zz, because the sound before was a vowel.
Monkeys, monkeys. So just a very quick,

34
00:02:39,552 --> 00:02:44,558
soft Z sound at the end there.
Barrel of monkeys.

35
00:02:44,559 --> 00:02:50,519
Monkey business. This can mean silliness. So
you might say to a room full of rowdy kids,

36
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:55,558
'Enough with the monkey business'. But,
it can also mean dishonest behavior.

37
00:02:55,559 --> 00:03:02,907
Monkey business. DA-da-DA-da. So, the first
syllable of 'business' is also stressed.

38
00:03:02,908 --> 00:03:08,731
This stressed syllable has the
IH as in SIT vowel, bu-, bu-,

39
00:03:08,732 --> 00:03:15,281
and the first S here represents the Z sound.
Bus-, business. The second syllable,

40
00:03:15,282 --> 00:03:21,588
since it's unstressed, should be very quick,
-ness, -ness, -ness. Business.

41
00:03:21,589 --> 00:03:23,556
Monkey business.

42
00:03:23,557 --> 00:03:28,075
Monkey suit. That's what I'm wearing!
That's the literal meaning.

43
00:03:28,076 --> 00:03:33,424
But there's also an idiomatic meaning, and
that's a tuxedo or other formal evening wear

44
00:03:33,425 --> 00:03:41,893
for men. Monkey suit. DA-da-da. Monkey suit.
So, the word 'suit' has the S consonant sound.

45
00:03:41,894 --> 00:03:47,839
The letters U-I represent the OO as in
BOO vowel, and we finish with a Stop T.

46
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,451
Monkey suit, monkey suit.

47
00:03:51,452 --> 00:03:54,295
Monkey on my back. This is a problem

48
00:03:54,296 --> 00:03:58,394
or something that's really stressful
that's taking a long time to resolve

49
00:03:58,395 --> 00:04:03,292
or won't go away. For example,
my friend is going through a nasty divorce.

50
00:04:03,293 --> 00:04:10,133
It's a monkey on his back. The stress pattern
is DA-da-da-da-DA. Monkey on his back.

51
00:04:10,134 --> 00:04:16,019
So, 'back' is stressed. The words 'on', and
the next function word, whether it's 'my',

52
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:22,000
'your', 'his', or 'her', will be unstressed.
So, 'on my', 'on my',

53
00:04:22,001 --> 00:04:27,990
those two words will be really quick, low
in pitch, and not too clear, on my, on my.

54
00:04:27,991 --> 00:04:34,559
Or, it could be 'on your', 'on your'. Notice
I'm reducing the word 'your' to 'yer'.

55
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:40,616
We've already made a video about that,
so check it out. 'On his' or 'on her'.

56
00:04:40,617 --> 00:04:46,709
In both of those cases, we'll probably drop 
the H. On his, on his, monkey on his back.

57
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:54,615
Or, on her, on her, monkey on her back. Check
out this video on Dropping the H Reductions.

58
00:04:54,616 --> 00:05:00,299
Have you ever heard someone say "I'm going
to go ape." That means to get really angry.

59
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:06,536
For example, if she screws up my car,
I'm going to go ape. Both 'go' and 'ape'

60
00:05:06,537 --> 00:05:13,630
are stressed, so the stress pattern is DA-DA.
Go ape. We have the G consonant sound and the

61
00:05:13,631 --> 00:05:18,173
OH as in NO diphthong.
Sometimes my students don't round their lips

62
00:05:18,174 --> 00:05:24,546
enough for the second half of this
diphthong, go, go, so make sure you do that.

63
00:05:24,547 --> 00:05:30,279
Ape. It begins with the AY as in SAY
diphthong. Make sure you drop your jaw enough

64
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:39,398
for the first sound of that diphthong, a-,
a-pe. And finally, the P sound, ape. Go ape.

65
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:43,489
There are more idioms that use the word 
'monkey'. Can you think of them?

I am dressed like a horse in that video.

68
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:58,587
That's it, and thanks so much for using
Rachel's English.

69
00:05:58,588 --> 00:06:03,429
Thanks to my friends Todd and Veronica for
the gibbons footage you saw in the background.

70
00:06:03,445 --> 00:06:06,662
Check out everyone's cool videos
that they made

71
00:06:06,663 --> 00:06:10,585
while visiting the gibbons
conservation center in California.

72
00:06:10,586 --> 00:06:36,569
 

73
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:40,416
I think that my back has fallen
open, but you can't see it, right?

74
00:06:40,424 --> 00:06:42,637
Like, it's not draping here or anything?

75
00:06:42,638 --> 00:06:51,017
 

76
00:06:51,018 --> 00:06:52,174
Thank you.
