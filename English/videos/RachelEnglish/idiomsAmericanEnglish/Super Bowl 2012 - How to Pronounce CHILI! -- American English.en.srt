00:00:00,539 --> 00:00:05,890
Have you ever wondered how to say the word
'chili'? In this American English pronunciation

2
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:12,199
video, you'll learn how to. I took my video
camera with me to two different Super Bowl parties.

3
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:25,800
>> You're going there first?
>> I'm going to Mark and Hillary's first.

4
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,610
I'm, I'm kind of going before, probably before--
>> I thought you were--

5
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:30,430
>> You thought what?
>> I thought you were coming after.

6
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:33,210
>> Well, I kind of decided that I might not
even--

7
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:42,990
Here I reduced 'kind of' to 'kinda'. I admit,
I'm talking really fast here. I wasn't actually

8
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:50,060
planning on using this footage. But it is
true that sometimes people do speak that quickly.

9
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:56,470
'Kind of' reduced to 'kinda'. Listen again.

10
00:00:56,470 --> 00:01:05,800
>> Well, I kind of decided that I might not
even-- [x3]

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,239
>> Well, I kind of decided that I might not
even stay through the end of the game.

12
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:16,640
>> Oh.
>> I just feel like I have a lot to do tomorrow

13
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,020
because I have a lot to get ready for.

14
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:24,350
>> Are you bringing anything?
>> Yeah, but I have to go to the store first.

15
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:26,540
I don't know what I'm going to bring. Do you
have any suggestions?

16
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:29,000
>> Um, no.

17
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:38,950
This is my friend Hillary, and yes, she's
a little crazy.

18
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:43,450
>> Hey, go Giants! AHHH!

19
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:47,280
>> This is my friend Mark, who's hosting a
Super Bowl party. Mark, who do you think's

20
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,880
going to win tonight?
>> I think the Patriots are going to win.

21
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,920
>> Why?
>> What?!?

22
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:57,470
>> I think the Patriots are going to win because
their offense is better than the Giants' defense.

23
00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:01,300
And, they've got Tom Brady and Super Bowl
experience.

24
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:06,320
>> How do you feel about saying that while
you are in the state of New York?

25
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:11,239
>> I'm from Philadelphia. So, I don't like
the Giants to start with, and I don't like

26
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:15,109
the Patriots either. So, I can be very objective.
>> You just wanted a reason to throw a good party.

27
00:02:15,109 --> 00:02:17,500
>> Exactly.
>> It works.

28
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,239
>> Hillary, who do you think's going to win?

29
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:24,999
>> I'm going Giants all the way. Um, I feel
like Eli Manning really brings it, um, he

30
00:02:24,999 --> 00:02:26,489
brings it to the table.
>> Uh-huh.

31
00:02:26,489 --> 00:02:34,840
Hillary used the idiom 'to bring something
to the table'. This means to provide a useful

32
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:42,329
skill. For example, I'm partnering with Tom
in my business because he's great at marketing.

33
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:49,279
He really brings something to the table. She
used a generic bring it to the table, meaning

34
00:02:49,279 --> 00:02:57,970
'it', that something special, in this case,
that makes one win football games. Listen again.

35
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:01,229
>> He brings it to the table. [x3]

36
00:03:03,529 --> 00:03:05,229
>> He brings it to the table.
>> Uh-huh.

37
00:03:05,229 --> 00:03:10,450
>> Um, I also think since we're in New York,
it's just more fun to root for the Giants.

38
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:13,189
>> I think you're right.
>> So, that's my take.

39
00:03:13,189 --> 00:03:16,829
>> And, can you tell me what you guys have
got going here? Now, I'm here early, I'm here

40
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:23,650
before all of the other guests. But I hear
that there's chili to be had.

41
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:30,029
>> There's tons of chili, vegetarian and meat.
>> Can you step through how to pronounce 'chili',

42
00:03:30,029 --> 00:03:30,849
Hillary?

43
00:03:30,849 --> 00:03:37,339
Did you notice? I reduced the word 'can'.
That's because it's a helping verb here, the

44
00:03:37,339 --> 00:03:44,339
main verb being 'step through'. Can you step
through. Kn, kn, can you step through. Listen

45
00:03:46,999 --> 00:03:47,409
again.

46
00:03:47,409 --> 00:03:50,459
>> Can you step through how to pronounce 'chili',
Hillary?

47
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:55,809
>> Uh, I would say 'chili'.
>> But how do you do it? What do you do to

48
00:03:55,809 --> 00:04:02,700
your mouth?
>> Well you, you go-- chuh, like, chuh-li--

49
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:06,700
>> Ok you know what guys? Forget her. I will
teach you how to say 'chili'.

50
00:04:07,819 --> 00:04:16,449
>> So, chili. It's a two syllable word, first
syllable is stressed. Chi-li. It begins with

51
00:04:16,449 --> 00:04:25,730
the CH consonant sound, ch, ch, opening into
the 'ih' as in 'sit' vowel, chi-. Then, there's

52
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:33,630
a dark L, so the tongue will pull back a little
bit, chil-, before finishing with the tongue

53
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:41,670
in the top position. Chil-i. Finally, the
unaccented syllable is the 'ee' as in 'she'

54
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:47,730
vowel. In both syllables, the vowel sound
is written with the I, but in the first syllable,

55
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:54,730
it represents the IH sound, and in the second
syllable, the EE sound.

56
00:04:56,690 --> 00:05:05,690
>> Chili. The first syllable tastes delicious.
The second syllable tastes delicious.

57
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:10,950
>> Isn't it really hot?
>> Chili, yum.

58
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:17,270
>> Mark, can I help you with anything?
>> No, I think I'm good. Thank you.

59
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:18,150
>> You're welcome.

60
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:26,280
Did you notice? Mark used the phrase 'I'm
good'. You can use this to decline an offer.

61
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:34,190
Would you like a glass of water? I'm good.
Can I get you anything else? I'm good. Can

62
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:38,660
I help you with anything? No, I think I'm
good. Listen again.

63
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:46,000
>> No, I think I'm good. Thank you. [x3]

64
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,890
>> No, I think I'm good. Thank you.

65
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:55,370
Now on to the next party for more chili 
and to watch the game.

66
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:59,810
>> Look! It's Eli Manning! I thought he was
going to be in Indianapolis at the game!

67
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:02,419
>> It's just me Dan.

68
00:06:05,009 --> 00:06:09,340
>> Thanks for watching my Super Bowl video.
Did you watch the Super Bowl? Leave a comment

69
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:10,180
if you did.

70
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:13,060
That's it, and thanks so much for using Rachel's
English.
